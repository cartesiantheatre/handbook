Resources, their volume, demand, value, and how they are utilzed  effects a city's economy. A city can take advantage of the resources it had available, giving it wealth through cheap materials or exports. Depending on technology, these resources can be obtained and used in different ways. Resources either imported of exported can be used to build or fund infrasture, their extraction can be the backbone of business and zoning, and its effective use may require ordinance being implemented. In addition, resources may attract negative attendtion from external interests (interest groups) and produce conflict. From this is can be seen that resources play a unique role to economic fundamentals, being either the fundamental point on which an economy is based, or hold a tertiary status within the city, being utilized for high levels of processing or political interest.
