\StartChapter{Characters}

Avaneya's characters come from a variety of places on Earth, as is to be expected of any space program with an international flavour. All of those deployed to Mars as part of the Avaneya Initiative have strong scientific backgrounds in their respective fields. Their theoretical knowledge is further supplemented with proven practical experience.

All of the characters' idiosyncrasies can and should be revealed indirectly whenever possible. This could be through body language, object symbolism, or perhaps the circumstance of the events they participate in. Whenever more direct means are appropriate, these could be through the character's participation in dialogue or through their own writings.

An introductory cinematic sequence is ideal for presenting the audience with the characters, though it may only have time to cover the most important ones. The leading character and protagonist, Arda Baştürk, should be the forefront and ought to be the game's most recognizable.
