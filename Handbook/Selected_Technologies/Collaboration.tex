\head {\em Git}

We will use Git for all revision control management. Our development model favours the {\it cathedral} approach, rather than the {\it bazaar}. For a project like this, we felt it more appropriate due to the amount of coordination necessary to produce a high quality commercial--grade game.

\head {\em Internet Relay Chat (IRC)}

We use IRC for some kinds of realtime communication over the internet when working with distributed parties. For more information, see \in{section}[Internet Relay Chat].
