\StartSection{Workforce & Economy}
What a city can produce, how much it can produce, and what it is capable of producing are largely byproduct of its workforce. The production, import and export of goods, and internal use of the goods make up the cities economy. This section discusses the variety of workforces, what they represent, how they are created and maintained, and what they are capable of. It also deals with a cities income and expenditures and how these are managed by the player.  

\StartSubSection{Workforce}
All objects and buildings are produced by a form of labour, what this is may change with technology or player choice, but this labour force must be able to a) exist, and b) travel to or exist at a production location.

A workforce is essentially another resource of either population or technology that needs to be either educated or built on a variety of levels and scales. Therefore its creation, maintainence, and control needs to be carefully managed by the player. A labour workfoce requires certain factors to bring it into fruition which may include a certain level of education, access to work, and perhaps even restrictions to to certain aspects of these. An intellectual workforce requires different factors to develop then a manual labour workforce. While the two are not mutually exclusive, it might become more difficult to create multiple classes in a single city. For discussions sake, workforce includes all labour factors driving the economy and extends to consumers (and even the homeless, criminals, and the unemployed). How people are raised, educated, and conditioned through experience largely determines their consumer patterns and may be reflected in a population's consumer choices.

Workforce is a dynamic resource that can move globally. If your workforce requires cheap housing and this becomes easier to gain in another city, many may migrate to this city seeking better opportunities. Likewise, they can move within your city to different opportunities. The movement within a city can be controlled to an extent to enable better or worse access to certain locations, increasing and decreasing travel time, or diverting travel for other means (likewise a workforce of machines can be moved with expense or stationary as in a production plant). Workforce is depicted visually by people or objects performing tasks or moving around the city. 

There are different fundamental types of workforce. There is a robotic/mechanical workforce and a human/biological/social workforce. The mechanical workforce requires research and development into avenues such a robotics and mechanical engineering with a social system in place requiring either the development of these to the eventual production and acceptance or the import of these and the acceptance by the population. The human workforce alternative is made up of human labour performing the tasks required by the society. This may be accepted to varying degrees also. Cities in Avaneya may also have a mix of these two workforce systems, indeed most will. In addition to a city producing its own workforce, it may purchase machinery, attract population, and hire individuals directly from other cities. While the city itself may purchase sometimes, the actually purchasing of individuals and machinery may take place by businesses. A cities governing player is primarily responsible for creating opportunities which can keep trained persons in the city or attracting such persons from cities. 

There will be underlying conditions that will determine what a cities workforce is comprised of and players will have certain degress of influence over the direction the workforce takes but if certain conditions aren't met the citizenry may not accept or appreciate the current workforce type with the vary consequences of innaction being varried. How players make these conditions and the direction they take with there workforce is a choice made in the sandbox style of play, it is a creation. They can create anything from human/animal labour pool to complete nanocracies with robotic workforces and humans indulging in deccandent pleasure palaces. The player can manage his city through inacting certain ordinance, directing funds, and other general city management processes including placement of civic buildings and diplomacy.

%Notes only
The dynamic and multifaceted nature of workforce may become more evident when reading about the various workforce types. From the list below it can be seen that workforce comprises what the population is doing in reaction to the cities governance or that of other cities.

Attributes of a workforce can overlap. An aspect of workforce could be tertiary educated but unemplyed, or a physical labourer with a secondary education. Also individuals may move between workforce types, as in moving through education levels or going from unemployed to employed. Some factors which change workforce types are done through time, other done through city management.

-Homeless
-Unemployed
-Physical labour (varying levels/classes, ie production, mining)
-Education (primary, secondary, tertiary, post tertiary [not complete, see education types])
-Employment skill (varying types depending on field, ie years of experience)
-Training (varying types, ie separate training that a business or government may provide)
-Criminal (varying types)
-Militia
-Consumer (varying types depending on influences, ie social eco status, cultural)
-Mechanical (varying) 
-Protester
