\startsection{Revision Control Management}
We use Bazaar for revision control. Our master branch is hosted on Launchpad. Here is how to interact with it. You can browse the master branch on Launchpad through a web browser by navigating it here:
@sp 0
@smallexample
@url{https://code.launchpad.net/~avaneya/avaneya/trunk}
@end smallexample
@sp 1

You may prefer to work with the source on your local machine instead of using a browser. To download and @i{install} Bazaar on Ubuntu, run the following:
@cartouche
@example
$ sudo aptitude install bzr 
@end example
@end cartouche
@sp 1

A @i{graphical user interface} for Bazaar that integrates well into Nautilus is available on Ubuntu. If you would like to use it, run the following command to download, install, and restart Nautilus to make it available:
@cartouche
@example
$ sudo aptitude install nautilus-bzr
$ killall -9 nautilus
@end example
@end cartouche
@sp 1

To @i{identify} yourself to Bazaar and in any commits you make, run the following:
@cartouche
@example
$ bzr whoami "Your Name <your@email_address.com>"
@end example
@end cartouche
@sp 1

To @i{checkout} a copy of the Avaneya source to a folder called Avaneya in the current working directory, run the following:
@cartouche
@example
$ lp:avaneya Avaneya
@end example
@end cartouche
@sp 1

To @i{update} your working copy to the latest revision in the Launchpad master branch, run the following within the directory you checked out your local working copy to:
@cartouche
@example
$ bzr update
@end example
@end cartouche
@sp 1

To check the commit @i{log}, run the following within the directory you checked out your local working copy to:
@cartouche
@example
$ bzr log | less
@end example
@end cartouche
@sp 1

If you are a member of the Avaneya Crew on Launchpad, you will have write access to the repository which is necessary to commit to the master branch. After making your changes, run the following within the directory you checked out your local working copy to see what files you have changed (@i{status}), what changed inside of them (@i{diff}), and to finally upload (@i{commit}) your changes to the master branch:
@cartouche
@example
$ bzr status
$ bzr diff
$ bzr commit --message "Some commit log message..."
@end example
@end cartouche
@sp 1
