\head {\em D-Bus}

The D-Bus (Desktop Bus) API is a simple inter-process communication (IPC) system for software applications to communicate with one another. Avaneya can use it to determine the state of the user's network connection, among other things. It is available only under supported POSIX compliant operating systems.
