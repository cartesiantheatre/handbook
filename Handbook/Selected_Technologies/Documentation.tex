\head {\em \BIBTEX}

As you have probably noticed, this book has hundreds of references. \BIBTEX\ is a well proven tool. It has been used for many years in various academic fields, ranging from the humanities to the natural sciences. It maintains a database of references and can provide a standardized interface for typesetting software like \CONTEXT\ to pull from.

\head {\em \CONTEXT}

We use \CONTEXT\ for typesetting important documents, such as this one. This document was compiled on \currentdate\ from Bzr revision \BzrRevisionClickable, typeset using \CONTEXT\ \contextversion, and rendered with \texenginename\ \texengineversion. 

One of the many beauties of using a programmable typesetting language like \CONTEXT\ is that documents written in them are {\tt diff} and {\tt patch} friendly. This makes collaboration easier.

\head {\em Doxygen}

As software increases in complexity, so does the need to document how it works. Doxygen is a tool that can generate \index{engineering documentation}engineering documentation on the fly. The documentation is derived from metadata hints at the source code level. It can even produce graphs that show the relationship between classes. This latter feature is actually implemented internally using another set of tools we depend on, Graphviz.

\head {\em Graphviz}

Graphviz is a powerful set of tools for drawing graphs specified in the DOT language. Among the suite it provides, {\tt dot} was used for several of our figures, like \in{figure}[figure:Resources_Pipeline].

\head {\em Umbrello}

Umbrello is a powerful diagramming tool. We used it to create our AresEngine's architectural design (UML models\index{UML models}) as seen in \in{section}[AresEngine's Architecture]. 

The two projects compliment each other and have had a friendly relationship in the past. Our design put a heavy demand on Umbrello. This was useful to Umbrello's developers in providing something to stress test and identify problems that might have otherwise been difficult to find.
