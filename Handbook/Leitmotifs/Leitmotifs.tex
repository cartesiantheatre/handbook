\StartChapter{Leitmotifs}

This is probably the most important chapter in this entire book. This game has several recurring ideas, or {\it leitmotifs}\index{leitmotifs}, within it. While they may seem unrelated, they are useful cues in reconstructing an occasionally dystopian world that reflects some of our most defining contemporary problems. 

These leitmotifs are sometimes difficult to establish as definitive truths in the real world. It is fair to consider them as opinions and so we do our best to substantiate what we can where we can.

\head {\em Government policy measures are sometimes advanced through orchestrated catastrophes.}

It is not unusual for significant foreign and domestic policy measures to be predicated on acts of staged terror or other orchestrated events by elements within government or its intelligence services for any of a number of reasons. Although the reasons may vary, the idea of providing false pretexts to socially engineer public opinion in favour of granting concessions it otherwise might not have is old. The strategy has been used for as long as governments have claimed a social contract of one form or another dependent on public opinion -- or at least seeking to maintain the perception of one.

There is an overwhelming body of historical evidence suggesting the synthetic nature of countless relevant seminal events. Prominent examples are found within at least the First World War,

If Seneca were alive today, he might have described these seminal acts of terrorism as real to the layperson, contrived to the educated, and useful to those who rule.

\head {\em Neoclassical economics is junk science.}

The core axioms of neoclassical economics, the backbone of contemporary economic theory, are wrong. Markets are not natural systems akin to the laws of thermodynamics.
\footnotecite[adbusters_issue_85]
\footnotecite[lasn2012]
\footnotecite[adbusters_jamming_neoclassical_economics]
Commercial advertising assists consumers in becoming less informed and less rational. This is the opposite of how markets are allegedly expected to behave. People do not always exercise rational preference, seek self maximization, always act on full and relevant information,

or stand the most to gain through competition over cooperation.

A nation's economic prosperity, as conventionally measured with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), does not reliably correlate with its level of happiness.
\footnotecite[anielski2007_economics_of_happiness] Therefore, it is not clear what exactly an economy is expected to do.

Every single critical life support system on our planet currently is in a steady state of decline. This is reflected in virtually all of the scientific journals over the past several decades. In spite of this, the basic tenets of neo--classical economics have not adapted. Some critics have described it as a pseudo--science inebriated with physics envy masquerading as a science.

\head {\em Drug policies do not reflect reality.}

The supply and distribution of a significant proportion of the most dangerous illicit narcotics found on the streets of developed nations are facilitated through covert indirect governmental support, intelligence agencies, and prominent financial institutions.

Public drug policies in Western nations are often criticized as ineffective. Critics argue that reforms are necessary because existing policies are unintentionally undermining the safety of those they were allegedly intended to protect,\footnotecite[geddes2013_politics_of_pot] or conversely more severe measures are necessary to continue to protect the general public.\footnotecite[extras={, p.~46.}][canadian_conservatives_platform2011] Both ends shared the assumption that the legislation was drafted in good faith -- however inadequate, naïve, misinformed, or ideologically driven its authorship. 

However, the assumption that public safety was ever a genuine consideration to begin with must be reconsidered if there is any compelling evidence that any amount of any type of illicit narcotic's production or distribution was coordinated within the highest levels of government. It may be more reasonable to say that the United States, as an example, was never serious to begin with than to explain away its self described \quote{War on Drugs} as a failure.

Drugs have been used for centuries by those in positions of influence to do everything from regulating our behaviour\footnotecite[wilson2007]\footnotecite[cook2000_canadian_war_rum]\footnotecite[samuel2010_french_bread_cia_lsd] to undermining the health and sovereignty of foreign nations.\footnotecite[wikipedia_opium_wars] 

Historical analysis reveals virtually no consistent rhyme or reason in how the social perception of a given narcotic correlated with the actual quantifiable level of harm implicated. Heroin was once a household children's cough medicine,\footnotecite[edwards2011_bayer_heroin_ads_for_children] opium in the snuffbox of every gentleman of distinction, and lithium was found in 7-Up.\footnotecite[best2014_lithium_7up] Today we reserve methamphetamine for the \quotation{junky}; Oreos for the office;\footnotecite[schroeder2013_oreos_like_drugs] and socially validated\footnotecite[ubc_wine_research_centre_home] alcohol overall more harmful\footnotecite[extras={ See figure 2.}][nutt2010] than crack cocaine and heroine for every other occasion. 

These arbitrary narcotic social values are whatever we need them to be, rationalized only after the fact that a historical precedent had already been established.

\head {\em No one is completely free.}

To be free is to be independent of influence which no one is. We are all subject to influence. Had it been otherwise there would never have been any prospect for commercial advertising, information would never have become a corporate commodity,\footnotecite[santoso2008]\footnotecite[nagata2011] and an honest media would never have become a rarity -- unavailable when its observations would have been valuable,

International government institutions espouse a commitment to universal human rights, equality before the law, and freedom from conflicts of interests while privately remaining reluctant to implement.
\footnotecite[extras={ {\it vid.} 26 minutes, 35 seconds onwards.}][un2013_secretary_general_golfing_partners]

Government tolerates democracy only so far as the latter remains merely cosmetic and is not permitted to actually function in any meaningful way.\footnotecite[extras={ Select the {\it Votes} column to sort demand by vote.}][occupy_poll] {\it Bona fide} democracies have no need for toggle switches.\footnotecite[wikipedia_order_in_council]\footnotecite[notwithstanding_clause]

This should not discourage people into believing that everyone in government ought to be treated with suspicion, or that government can never be a constructive influence in civic life. There are many in government that strive to improve the quality of life for everyone. The problem is simply that they are seldom found in positions of any meaningful authority.

\head {\em Man can dig his own grave with his knife and fork; allopathic medicine is largely institutionalized fraud.}

Disease begins on the plate.\footnotecite[extras={ According to Campbell, all of the top three causes of death in Canada in 2007 identified by StatsCan are entirely dietary.}][statscan_leading_causes_of_death] This is the reason for the disease state that we live in since nutrition and exercise are not as lucrative as merely treating symptoms.

or heal us.
\footnotecite[cavusoglu2009]

Conventional medicine is allopathic medicine. Allopathic medicine is pharmaceutical medicine. Pharmaceutical medicine culminated in 106,000 fatalities in 1994 due to adverse drug reactions (ADR), just in the United States, not counting overdoses, and under the direction of credentialed allopaths. This placed the paradigm between the United States' fourth and sixth leading causes of death in that year.\footnotecite[lazarou1998_adr] By estimation approximately 2,700,000 fatalities can be attributed to the use of allopathic medications between the years of 1983--2010.\footnotecite[prousky2012_toxicology]\footnotecite[lindsey2012_vitamins_and_diabetes]\footnotecite[leape2000] 

Treatment aside, even just the allopathic approach to preventative medicine has been at least as damning.\footnotecite[miller2011_vaccination_infant_mortality] Additionally, the health insurance industry has little interest in the health and well being of the general public.\footnotecite[mohan2010_manulife_clown_food]\footnotecite[boyd2009_insurance_tobacco]

By contrast, in considering the dangers of some natural treatments, but twelve fatalities were allegedly attributable to vitamin supplements during that same time span of 1983--2010.\footnotecite[aapcc_annual_reports] Note that these were allegations only and remain unproven. 

Natural treatments are frequently referred to as \quotation{alternative medicine}. Given that natural approaches have been used for at least 20,000 years,\footnotecite[hardy2012] with the allopathic paradigm a relatively late comer in recent centuries, merit of either aside, it is more rational to reserve the term \quotation{alternative} to that which proposes a deviation from an established norm -- especially when alternative to some {\it is} the established norm for many.\footnotecite[trofimova2013_russia_alternative_medicine]

\head {\em Agribusiness is destroying the planet.}

Agriculture is our principle means of interacting with the planet. Changing how we produce, distribute, and select our food solves many global problems.\footnotecite[un2006_rearing_cattle_greenhouse_gases]\footnotecite[worldwatch2009_livestock_and_climate_change]\footnotecite[foodwaste]\footnotecite[food_inc]\footnotecite[food_matters]

\head {\em Subjugation of a nation can be made through debt without resorting to the overt use of force.}

Usury, including fractional reserve banking, is a form of slavery.\footnotecite[the_creature_from_jekyll_island]\footnotecite[minutes_bank_of_canada] One might argue therefore that trading in debt is the most prevalent form of human trafficking. Debt is the tool of choice in an era of globalization.\footnotecite[perkins2005] This theme will be explored in \in{section}[Combat Globalization].

\head {\em Corporations are not people.}

The notion that corporations deserve the same rights as living human beings has proven itself absolutely catastrophic.\footnotecite[the_corporation]\footnotecite[coca_cola_case] People have been running shipping companies and selling wares for thousands of years without requiring legal fictions. This theme will be expanded upon in sections \in{}[Corporate Personhood] and \in{}[Money As Free Speech].

\head {\em Genes are a cop out.}

Very little of what we call human nature is actually genetic. Genes specify human needs, not behaviour. There is no such thing as \quotation{default} human behaviour. Some of what we call human nature is cultural and environmental influences that are not universal. Our theories of morality to the way we reason about space and time are sometimes subject to environmental influences.\footnotecite[henrich2010] Where the line is drawn between variability and the deterministic still remains controversial. This will be expanded upon in \in{section}[Socio-economic Simulation]. 
\stopitemize

It is probably obvious now, but those working on this game are challenged to read and think critically. This is especially challenging in an era where it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so.\footnotecite[wilson2014_attention_span_electrocution]
