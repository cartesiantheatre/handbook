\StartChapter{How To Read This Book}

Large books can be intimidating. Fortunately, most people need not read this one in its entirety -- though there is certainly little to lose in doing so.

For the passive or casual non-technical reader who simply wants the \quote{Cole's notes} on the project, we suggest chapters \in[Leitmotifs], \in[The Game], \in[Leading Characters], \in[Timeline], and \in[Game Mechanics] as a minimum.

For contributors, it is beneficial to read the whole book, with the exception of \in{chapter}[Engineer Contributors], unless you would like to get involved in an engineering capacity. Otherwise, you will probably just end up confused, with a headache, and benefiting from the content that is relevant to your speciality. For more on the variety different specialities, take a look at \in{section}[Specialities].
