\StartChapter{How To Read This Book}

Be honest. Large books are intimidating. Fortunately, at least in the case of this one, most people need not read it in its entirety. Having said that, contributing community members certainly have nothing to lose in doing so. We tried to organize it in such a way that readers benefit the most when its chapters are explored in the order presented within the book.

Depending on the audience, different parts of this book will appeal more so to some than others. We describe who {\it you} might be in the context of a member of our open community in \in{chapter}[Specialities]. But if you happen to be an editor for this book, you should turn right away to \in{section}[Editing This Handbook] for instructions on how to properly go about doing this.

If you are a passive, casual, or non-technical reader, simply wanting the Coles Notes on the project, we encourage you to check out chapters \in[Leitmotifs], \in[The Game], \in[Leading Characters], and \in[Timeline] at a minimum. This should get you up to speed in as little time as possible.

If you already are, or would like to consider becoming a member of our community, you would probably do well to read most of the book. One noteworthy exception is \in{chapter}[Engineer Contributors], unless you would like to get involved in an engineering capacity, or you are simply curious of the types of problems the engineers will have to deal with.

With all of that out of the way, on we go!
