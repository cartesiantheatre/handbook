\head {\em Audacity}

We use Audacity for audio recording, editing, post-processing, effects, and more. It can take advantage of any of the multitude of LADSPA and VST plugins. It can also export to surround sound formats, such as AC3 and DTS.

\head {\em libmikmod}

We use libmikmod for playback of tracker music modules. Some people were requesting tracker support, and since it should not take very much effort to integrate into the engine's {\about[AudioManager]} subsystem, it seems reasonable. The library also needs to be built thread safe.

\head {\em OpenAL}

OpenAL is used for 3D spatial audio rendering. Actual decoding of audio data is done through other APIs.

\head {\em SDL_audio}

The SDL library is used to provide audio decoding through its SDL_audio API. It decodes popular formats like Ogg Vorbis. Since we are dependent on some features that are bleeding edge, like haptic support, we require SDL 1.3. Since it is unlikely that any distributions carry it at present, we may have to provide Ubuntu packages.
