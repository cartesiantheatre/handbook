Footage of alleged riots erupting across Arcadia with security forces responding disproportionately are aired across Earth. Mainstream media attribute the alleged riots to grievances expressed by dissenters at variance with Free Arcadia partisans who apparently relied upon use of force to silence them, but now, like Arda, hold public office at Arcadia Hall. The dissenters are coined {\it Red Unionists}. Several critics note the equivalence of Terran gravity in some of the footage allegedly obtained by citizens {\it in situ} but are rapidly dismissed by mainstream media as \quote{cranks} and \quote{conspiracy theorists}.

The United Nations Security Council passes resolution 12664 where it is adopted unanimously. The contents of the resolution are not as of yet made public, but kept internal. It begins with:

\startTimelineGeneralDocument
The Security Council,

Reaffirming the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations,

Determined to combat by all means threats to transplanetary peace and security caused by terrorist acts,

Deploring the gross and systematic violation of human rights, including the repression of peaceful demonstrators, expressing deep concern at the deaths of civilians, and rejecting unequivocally the incitement to hostility and violence against the civilian population and infrastructure excited through {\it in situ} administrative elements of the United Nations Arcadian Settlement,

Recognizing the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in accordance with the Charter,

\startitemize[n]
\setupwhitespace[big]
\item Unequivocally condemns in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks which took place recently at the site of the No. \type{#}2 Railgun on Mars in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement and regards such acts, like any act of international terrorism on Earth, as a threat to transplanetary peace and security;

\item Expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims, their families, and of the United Nations Arcadian Settlement;

\item Calls on all Mars Treaty signatories to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these acts will be held accountable;

\item Calls also on all Mars Treaty signatories to redouble their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts including by increased cooperation and full implementation of the relevant anti-terrorist conventions and Security Council resolutions;

\item Expresses its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks of the Arcadian Settlement railgun bombing, and to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations;

\item Authorizes Mars Treaty signatories that have notified the Secretary-General, acting nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements, and acting in cooperation with the Secretary-General and the Office of the President of the Space Agency, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians, civilian populated areas, and assets under threat of attack in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement, and requests those signatories concerned to inform the Secretary-General immediately of the measures they take pursuant to the authorization conferred by this paragraph which shall be immediately reported to the Security Council;

\item Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.\footnote{Most Security Council resolutions end with this phrase. Article 12 of the United Nations charter states that \quote{While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.} In other words, the General Assembly of many is being instructed by the Security Council of few to not interfere in an affair the latter still wishes to handle exclusively.}

\StartTimelineDate{A.R.}
The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations' {\it Joint Chiefs of Staff} assemble in Brussels, European Union. There they liaise with government officials and other high level military UN servants for the first day of a three month summit. The summit is conducted under maximum security. Though its existence is made public, the exercise of a high level of discretion in all of its activities ensures that its nature is not. This draws public criticism due to the presence of a number of high level state officials from across the planet and the lack of transparency.

Rumours spread rapidly over the solnet purporting the purpose of the summit as one of planning the first off world military occupation of another planet in history. Leaked documents suggest the summits agenda is to assess the feasibility, followed by addressing the preparation of all strategic, intelligence gathering, logistical, personnel, and financial planning necessary to conduct such an operation. Known high level UNSA liaisons, including UNSA's President Dr. Samuel Lieberman, are captured on camera being hustled in and out of meetings within the compound. Public speculation is further compounded when representatives of major international financial institutions and the NAU CIA director are also captured on camera by independent media.

UNDPKO's summit in Brussels concludes with the establishment of the newly formed {\it Mars Command (MARSCOM)}. It is established under the civilian administered UNDPKO and is now responsible for overseeing all of the latter's peacekeeping operations at the strategic level, in the route to, in the vicinity of, and on the Red Planet. The headquarters is located at Peterson Air Force Base, North American Union, and is jointly staffed by an international consortium of military personnel from all nations signatory to the Mars Treaty.

Arda receives an asymmetrically encrypted message warning of an allegedly imminent plan that was drafted by a consortium of Terran financial interests. The information was allegedly all drawn from leaked source material. The anonymous tip-off claims these interests have influenced the United Nations such that it is prepared to organize and land a brigade of peacekeepers to Martian theatre. The brigade will operate under UNSA's newly formed MARSCOM, which itself operates as an organ of the United Nations, which in turn allegedly answers to the Terran central banking cartels. 

The field commanders on the ground would be tasked with several prioritized strategic objectives while in theatre.

The anonymous informant provides detailed information on troop movement to Terran MARSCOM administered training facilities, size of units, weapons and tactics to be employed, probable location of encampment, and route of approach. The brigade will be deployed to Martian theatre under the banner of {\it United Nations Mars Expeditionary Peacekeeping Force (UNMEPF)}. The force draws elements mostly from North American Union and European Union resources specializing in airborne and mechanized infantry, armoured reconnaissance, tactical UAVs, self-propelled artillery, and logistical support.

The message is encrypted using a public key of Arda's not used since his long departed days of a military posting with the European Union's Mountain and Commando Brigade in Hakkari. He and his staff deem the message credible.

Arda orders the taking out of UNSA orbital surveillance capabilities by destroying UNSA's {\it Mars Enhanced Telecommunications Orbiter} while the settlement still has access. UNSA detects the settlement login attempt and transmits a command sequence instructing the orbiter to revoke Arcadia's keypair. They are several minutes too late. The orbiter burns up its entire hydrazine fuel reserves used for attitude control, deorbiting itself and incinerating during atmospheric entry.

All solnet communications between Earth and Mars that had been brokered by METO are now effectively disabled. However, the orbiter had also been used for reliable Arcadian intercommunication. Arcadians adapt in its absence with a combination of line-of-sight UHF and shortwave communication, requiring no satellite.

UNSA has its JPL lock down all four {\it Mars Positioning Satellites} in expectation of an RAP denial-of-service attack, though Arda has no intention of launching one. Arda's staff reason the satellites have no use as UNSA surveillance assets and are still useful for their own navigation on the Red Planet.

Arcadia completes its evacuation. Movement of non-essential materials from the city to the underground installation now begins.

Within the underground installation, and with the city evacuated, Arda explains to the settlers the current situation. He holds an election on the raising of several militia units. The vote carries with a majority.

As commander-in-chief of Arcadia's new non-existent military, Arda puts out a call for any settlers with previous military training. A list is assembled with more than a hundred, and with approximately half of that with extensive training and experience. This has never been unusual in the field of manned space exploration. These even include Arda.
\StopTimelineDate

\StartTimelineDate{A.R.}
Relying on a synthesis of military training manuals remaining on Arcadian local solnet caches, his own personal experience, the council of former military personnel in the settlement, and knowledge of the current state of Arcadia's industrial infrastructure, such as milling and robotic assembly machines, Arda begins drafting a plan for a measured response to meet an expected UNSA landing of a military force. The {\it Republic of Arcadia Planitia's Militia (RAPM)} portfolio and organization is created in the passage of legislation.

Today marks the first of a series of meetings held over the next several months on the recruitment, organization, and equipping of an indigenous militia. The meetings are an {\it ad hoc} committee of settlement personnel with experience ranging from industrial processes, former military experience, mechanics, leadership and management, chemists, and so on. This {\it City Security Committee} acts as a think tank to Arda and his staff.

Arda reasons that Arcadia has a minimum of nine months to prepare, assuming UNSA experiences no delays in equipping, training, and a launch. If any time remains between the end of that nine months and the arrival of UNSA forces, that time can be used for expanding their capabilities. 

To console doubts, Arda further reasons that UNSA would not take the risk of deploying a military force, and all the costs that accompany it, across the solar system unless they were confident the settlers would not be capable of defending themselves.
\StopTimelineDate

\StartTimelineDate{A.R.}
Arda, with settlement approval, authorizes the use of subterranean areas of Arcadia for the garrison of several militia units to be created. These would include everything from drill halls to training facilities. The units planned are as follows:

\item {\it 1\high{st} People's Own Mechanized Infantry}. This will be an infantry regiment equipped with armoured personnel carriers.

\item {\it 2\high{nd} Arcadian Dragoons}. This will be an armoured regiment capable of providing armoured reconnaissance services.

Plans for a feasible battle rifle capable of operating under extreme Martian atmospheric conditions are presented before the {\it City Security Committee} where they are well received. The R1A1 battle rifle is a gas-operated self-loading weapon. It is an adaptation of the former Terran Coldwar era FN FAL. Although antiquated, the weapon is relatively simple to manufacture and is already well proven in extreme arctic and high altitude climates. This is important because those climates share the closest environmental similarities to Mars. Everything needed for its manufacture is already available at Arcadia's disposal.

The receiver and heavy barrel are made from steel. Though steel is heavy, it ways only a third what it does on Earth. Its weight was a large reason for it having been abandoned by Terrans, though its performance was remarkable.

The stock is modified to use a light weight composite hemp plastic. The material is stiff, has a high heat tolerance, flame retardant, and is biodegradable.

The weapon features both steel sights and an optical scope. The steel sight has tritium markings that glow to aid with sighting at night. The optical scope is capable of night vision and thermal imaging.

The receiver is chambered to a 7.62 x 51 mm round. Since the production of aluminium is a fairly energy intensive process on Mars, magnesium alloy is used in the casings. The ejection port is modified to have a cover which the original design did not. This is to keep out very fine iron oxide dust which is sometimes as small as 1.5 μm. The gas mechanism requires some modification from the original design to manage the gas differential of a high chamber pressure contrasted with the near vacuum of Mars.

A removable grenade launcher can be mounted underneath. It can chamber a variety of cartridges. These may be magnesium flares, smoke grenades, or \quote{cryonades}. Cryonades are small bombs containing liquid oxygen and methane. Armourers must ensure that these explosive cartridges are stored, when not in use, at cryogenic temperatures to prevent them from degassing.

The weapon should be able to operate in temperatures as low as \math{-90^{\circ}}C, which is the primary concern. Issues with icing will be addressed later with field trials.
