The United Nations Security Council passes resolution 12664 where it is adopted unanimously. Announcement of the resolution is not yet made public, but is to be deferred until 28 Scorpius. The resolution contains the following.

\startTimelineGeneralDocument
The Security Council,

Reaffirming the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations,

Determined to combat by all means threats to transplanetary peace and security caused by terrorist acts,

Deploring the gross and systematic violation of human rights, including the repression of peaceful demonstrators, expressing deep concern at the deaths of civilians, and rejecting unequivocally the incitement to hostility and violence against the civilian population and infrastructure excited through rogue elements within the United Nations Arcadian Settlement's local administration,

Recognizing the inherent right of individual or collective self--defence in accordance with the Charter,

\startitemize[R]
\item Unequivocally condemns in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks which took place recently at the site of the No. \type{#}2 Railgun on Mars in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement and regards such acts, like any act of international terrorism on Earth, as a threat to transplanetary peace and security;

\item Expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims, their families, and of the United Nations Arcadian Settlement;

\item Calls on all Mars Treaty signatories to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these acts will be held accountable;

\item Calls also on all Mars Treaty signatories to redouble their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts including by increased cooperation and full implementation of the relevant anti--terrorist conventions and Security Council resolutions;

\item Expresses its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks of the Arcadian Settlement's railgun bombing, and to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations;

\item Authorizes Mars Treaty signatories that have notified the Secretary--General, acting nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements, and acting in cooperation with the Secretary--General and the Office of the President of the Space Agency, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians, civilian populated areas, and assets under threat of attack in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement, and requests those signatories concerned to inform the Secretary--General immediately of the measures they take pursuant to the authorization conferred by this paragraph which shall be immediately reported to the Security Council;

\item Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.%\footnote{Most Security Council resolutions end with this phrase. Article 12 of the United Nations Charter states that while it \quote{\it is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation...the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation...unless the Security Council so requests.} In other words, the General Assembly of many is being instructed by the Security Council of few to not interfere in an affair the latter still wishes to handle exclusively for the time being.}

The resolution recommends that the {\it United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO)} immediately place the multinational contingents under its permanently standing {\it Rapid Reaction Force} on high alert. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter is cited as the legal basis for the use of force which allows for \quote{\it the inherent right of individual or collective self--defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.}

The organization is an association of Terran states advocating the doctrine of non--alignment. They define this as \quote{\it respect for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of states as they strive for freedom from imperialism, all forms of colonialism, racism, foreign aggression, occupation, domination, and interference.} The constituents include the states of Venezuela, Iran, Ecuador, Cuba, and others.

The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations' {\it Joint Chiefs of Staff} assemble in Brussels, European Union. There they liaise with government officials and other high level military UN servants for the first day of a three month summit. The summit is conducted under maximum security with no access to the press. 

Though the summit's existence is made public, the exercise of a high degree of discretion in all of its activities ensures that its nature is not. The lack of transparency draws widespread criticism from mainstream media due to the presence of a number of high level state officials from across the world.

Rumours spread rapidly purporting the purpose of the summit as one of planning the first off--world military operation in history. Leaked documents suggest the summit's agenda is at least concerned with assessing the feasibility, strategic planning, intelligence gathering, logistical, personnel, and the financial considerations necessary to conduct such an ambitious operation. Known high level UNSA liaisons, including incumbent president, Dr. Samuel Lieberman, are captured on camera being hustled in and out of meetings within secured areas.

Public speculation is increased when representatives of major international financial institutions are caught on camera leaving the vehicle parkade by independent journalists. 

The NAU--CIA director's presence is later confirmed when a local escort service discloses to local media the director's refusal to settle a bill for unpaid services at a hotel he was residing in. For the duration of the summit, the hotel was known to be exclusively restricted to summit attendees and their support staff for security reasons.

UNDPKO's summit in Brussels concludes with the quiet establishment of the newly formed {\it Mars Command (MARSCOM)}. This is established under the civilian administered UNDPKO and is now responsible for overseeing all of the latter's peacekeeping operations at the strategic level, in transit to, in the vicinity of, and on the Red Planet. The headquarters is located at Peterson Air Force Base, North American Union, and is jointly staffed by an international consortium of military personnel from all nations signatory to the Mars Treaty.

A large volume of requests for quotation for the procurement of military equipment are disseminated to a multitude of defence contractors.

Dr. Ishmael, a prominent senior level civilian scientist stationed at a now multipurpose UNSA training facility publicly writes the {\it Antarctic Treaty Secretariat}\index{Antarctic Treaty Secretariat} headquartered in Buenos Aires, South American Union. He expresses his concerns that Article I of the {\it Antarctic Treaty System}\index{Antarctic Treaty System} of 1961 A.D. prohibits the use of \quote{\it any measures of a military nature, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, and the carrying out of military manoeuvres in Antarctica.} The Secretariat releases a public statement acknowledging the build--up of military personnel and expresses her concern by acknowledging her commitment to the treaty with its official depositary, the North American Union.

The North American Union's Secretary of State\index{North American Union Secretary of State} responds by clarifying that the UNSA training facilities are still under a civilian mandate and therefore a military presence for peaceful purposes remains consistent with treaty obligations.

Arda receives an asymmetrically encrypted message warning of an allegedly imminent plan drafted by a consortium of influential Terran interests. The informant claims to have drawn the information from leaked source material made available through software vulnerabilities in the proprietary firewall protecting UNSA intranets. 

The anonymous tip--off claims these interests have influence over the United Nations and warn that it is preparing to organize and land a brigade of peacekeepers to Martian theatre. The brigade ({\it MARSBRIG}) would operate under UNSA's newly formed MARSCOM, which itself operates as a newly formed organ of the United Nations, which in turn, according to the informant, answers to these private interests.

Field commanders on the ground are to be tasked with several prioritized strategic objectives while in theatre. Among the digital dossier provided by the informant, Arda locates a memorandum outlining all of the alleged objectives described in detail in the file {\tt COSMIC_TOP_SECRET_PROTECTED_C-000521-MJCS-SETREC}.

The anonymous informant provides detailed information on troop movement to Terran MARSCOM administered training facilities, size of units, weapons and tactics to be employed, probable location of encampment, and route of approach. The brigade will be deployed to Martian theatre under the banner of the {\it United Nations Mars Expeditionary Peacekeeping Force (UNMEPF)}. The force draws elements mostly from North American Union and European Union units specializing in airborne and mechanized infantry, armoured reconnaissance, tactical UAVs, self--propelled artillery, and logistical support.

The message is encrypted using a public key of Arda's not used since his long departed days of a military posting with the European Union's Mountain and Commando Brigade in Hakkari. Khalid determines the digital signature to be authentic. Arda and his cabinet deliberate before concluding the message to be credible.

Khalid advises Arda that he can take out UNSA's orbital surveillance capabilities by destroying the {\it Mars Enhanced Telecommunications Orbiter} while the settlement still has access. Arda gives him a green light. UNSA detects the settlement login attempt and transmits a command sequence instructing the orbiter to revoke Arcadia's keypair, but is several minutes too late. The orbiter burns up its entire hydrazine attitude control fuel reserves, deorbits, and incinerates during atmospheric entry.

All solnet communications between Earth and Mars that had been brokered by METO are now effectively disabled. However, the orbiter had also been used for reliable Arcadian intercommunication. Khalid improvises in METO's absence by refitting key settlement communications equipment to combine line--of--sight VHF and, where that fails, ionosphere reflected shortwave communications. Both methods do not require a satellite.

UNSA has the Jet Propulsion Laboratory lock down all four {\it Mars Positioning Satellites} and places them in safe mode in anticipation of an RAP denial--of--service attack, though none comes. Arda's staff reason the satellites have no use as UNSA surveillance assets and are still useful for their own navigation on the Red Planet where ground based transponders are still unavailable in many remote regions.

Ishmael's wife, a physician, who had been living at the facility with her husband at the time is interviewed by independent media where she claims the incisions were non--fatal, there was insufficient blood on the scene as expected from a major artery, the report did not indicate any liquids at the scene that could be used to consume the painkillers, and that the dosage had been non--fatal.

Arcadia completes its evacuation of all non--essential personnel. The movement of non--essential materials and Arcadia Hall's administrative personnel out of the city to the underground installation commences immediately following. A make--shift facility for the staff and functions of Arcadia Hall is erected within the shelter and given the same name.

Excavation begins for the construction of unpressurized underground passageways linking the shelter which is outside of the city with entrances within it. Usage of tunnel entrances within the city help to ensure that vehicle tracks spotted from orbital telemetry cannot be used to pinpoint the location of the underground installation outside of the city. 

Senka predicts the tracks that are already present on the surface will be erased through surface wind deposition and erosion during the seasonal dust storm, assuming one should occur. This normally occurs during the orbital perihelion when the planet is at its closest to the sun.

Within the underground installation, and with most of the city evacuated, Arda gathers the settlers to provide an explanation for the recent commotion surrounding their evacuation and the dangerous predicament they now face. Influenced by Vattel's {\it Law of Nations}, Arda compels them that it is within their \quote{natural rights} the option of collective self--defence since, regardless of whether they decide to take up arms or not, they must realize that they will soon enough be confronted with someone else's.

Arda reminds the settlers that their constitution already permits the raising of militias. A referendum is held on the raising of several units to provide protection for Arcadians and the city. The settlers are generally reluctant, but see it as a last resort. The vote carries with a majority.

Arda explains to his colleagues that since prior military service is not unusual in the field of manned space exploration, putting out a call for all such settlers would be a reasonable place to start. A list is assembled with more than a hundred personnel responding. Approximately half of that having extensive experience, Arda included.

\StartTimelineDate{2 Capricorn, 0 A.R.}
Relying on a combination of military training manuals remaining on Arcadian local solnet caches, personal experiences, knowledge of the current state of Arcadia's industrial infrastructure, such as milling and robotic assembly machines, Arda begins the first of several day's with his cabinet on a measured response to an expected landing of a UN military force.

The sol also marks the first of a series of meetings held over the next several months on the recruitment, organization, and equipping of an indigenous militia. The meetings are held by an {\it ad hoc} advisory group called the {\it City Security Committee}. It consists of settlement personnel with experience ranging from industrial processes, ex--military, mechanics, various managerial roles, chemists, engineers, and others. Acting as a think tank, they are formed to provide potential solutions to the prospects of an armed confrontation with UN forces.

Arda reasons that Arcadia has a minimum of nine months to prepare for the arrival of United Nations forces, assuming the latter experiences no delays in the equipping, training, launch, and delivery of their brigade. If they take longer, the militia can expand its capabilities as much as time permits. To console doubts, Arda further reasons that the United Nations would not assume the risk of deploying a military force across the solar system with all the political and economic liabilities that accompany it without the necessary confidence that the settlers would not be capable of defending themselves. He likens MARSCOM's overconfidence to an Achilles' heel.

The {\it Arcadian Militia} is established on paper, but its creation does not extend beyond that. Arda assumes responsibility over the null portfolio as Commander--in--Chief and begins with authorizing the creation of the first {\it Arcadian School of Asymmetric Warfare\index{asymmetric warfare}} with professional development courses available to personnel of all ranks under the tutelage of ex--military personnel.

With settlement approval, Arda authorizes the use of subterranean areas of Arcadia for the garrison of several militia units yet to be created. These would include everything from drill halls and supply depots to training facilities.

Plans for a feasible service rifle capable of operating under the extreme environmental conditions Mars presents are proposed before the {\it City Security Committee} by a team of highly skilled machinists. The plans are well received. 

The R1A1 service rifle is a gas--operated, self--loading, air--cooled, magazine--fed, shoulder--fired, kinetic energy weapon. It is a modernized adaptation of the former Terran Coldwar era FN FAL. Everything required for its simple and rapid manufacture is already at Arcadia's disposal.

The receiver and heavy barrel are made of an alloyed magnesium. Though the original design called for heavier steel, the magnesium is lighter and when alloyed allows for flexibility. These metal components are treated with a protective finish that matches in tan colour the sands of {\it Arcadia Planitia}. Even with the original weapon weighing only a third on Mars what it would on Earth, the design modifications still produce a weapon that is lighter.

The stock is modified to use a lightweight composite hemp plastic. The material is stiff, has a high heat tolerance, flame retardant, and incidentally is biodegradable. The stock contains a battery power source to provide energy to an integrated heating element within the receiver to reduce misfires due to frosting.

The weapon features both magnesium alloy sights and an ROA1 detachable optical scope for target acquisition, heavily adapted for Martian ballistics where the Terrestrial point blank needs to be moved from a 200 metre mark up to 700 metres. The front and rear sights bear small sealed tritium markings that provide a small glow to aid in night sighting. The optical scope has night vision, thermal imaging, and laser range finder capabilities.

The receiver is chambered to the already well field tested Terran 7.62x51mm round. A magnesium alloy is selected for the cartridge casing. The ejection port is modified with a cover which the original design did not have. This reduces the likelihood of very fine Martian iron oxide dust as small as 1.5μm from entering the breech and fouling the action.

The gas regulator also requires a departure from the original design. This is to manage the greater gas differential of the high chamber pressure contrasted with the near vacuum of Mars at the end of the muzzle.

An RGA1 anti--personnel breech loaded launcher is optionally mounted beneath the barrel and can chamber a variety of cartridges. These include magnesium flares, smoke grenades, or \quote{cryonades}. 

Cryonades are small explosive shells that contain a volatile mixture of cryogenic liquid oxygen and methane. Armourers are instructed that these latter explosive cartridges must be stored when not in use at cryogenic temperatures to prevent them from becoming inert through degassing.

Although the original design that formed the basis for this new adaptation is antiquated, the weapon is relatively simple to manufacture and already well proven in the extreme arctic and high altitude climates of Earth. The committee notes that this is important since these climates share the closest environmental similarities with Mars. The weapon should be able to operate in temperatures as low as \math{-90^{\circ}}C. The committee suggests that any frosting issues that may arise will have to be addressed later with field trials and special chemically engineered lubricants.
