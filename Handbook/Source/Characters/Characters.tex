\StartChapter{Characters}

Avaneya's characters come from a variety of places on Earth. Those deployed as part of the Avaneya Initiative to Mars all have strong scientific background in their respective fields with demonstrated practical experience. This is to be expected of any space program with an international flavour.

The character attributes are best revealed indirectly. This could mean through body language, object symbolism, dialogue, and events they were involved in. The introductory cinematic sequence is ideal, though it may not be able to cover all characters. The most important character to present is the protagonist, Arda Baştürk. He should be the game's most identifiable fictional character.
