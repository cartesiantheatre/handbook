\StartTimelineDate{1 Gemini, 2 B.R.}
The beginning of a new year is marked with the first of a long series of partisan meetings for settlement independence held in secret. Arda, Henrik, Khalid, Nayana, and Senka are in attendance. The underground effort is discreetly coined {\it Free Arcadia}\index{Free Arcadia}. Leonard is not informed of the gathering.

\StartTimelineDate{4 Pisces, 1 B.R.}
The settlement holds an inauguration ceremony following Arda having won a landslide election. He accepts executive office as President of a newly formed interim settlement government of limited self--imposed independence. Arda and his staff operate from within the newly erected {\it Arcadia Hall}. UNSA acknowledge neither the interim government nor the occurrence of an election.

Leonard strongly cautions Arda in private against the {\it "formation of redundant administrative organs inconsistent with UNSA strategic interests"}. On Earth, the Security Council holds an emergency meeting in New York on the settlement situation.

\StartTimelineDate{7 Pisces, 1 B.R.}
Promoted from the position of United Nations Deputy Secretary--General, Security Council Resolution 12661 is adopted appointing Leonard to the newly created {\it Office of the Governor of the Arcadian Settlement} in response to the settlement's self initiated election. Though UNSA does not actually acknowledge the election in the wording of the resolution, the appointment asserts the Governor's seniority to any of the settlement's self elected public officers. Arcadia Hall does not issue a statement in response to the Security Council resolution.

Intending to reach the general public of both planets, Arda formally addresses the Secretary--General of the United Nations through an open letter posted on the solnet.

Arda's publicly accessible transmission over the solnet is accompanied with copies of all settlement research to date. He also includes a copy of the {\it Rubicon Act}. 

The {\it Rubicon Act}, also known more formally as the {\it Constitution of the Republic of Arcadia Planitia}, is the first of the settlement's self--declared legislation. Its aim is to initiate and secure the colony's independence. The document was the product of years of underground drafting through covertly held partisan meetings and, if successful, would beget the first off--world autonomous city--state in human history. The cultural significance to Arcadians is such that their calendar uses the event as its year zero epoch. Summaries of some notable portions follow.

A failed denial--of--service attack lodged against the Terran solnet downlink station at UNSA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Earth attempts to disrupt reception of Arda's transmission. Khalid advises the station's technicians that the attack originated from within the Terran station's own local intranet from behind a restricted access zone using several zero day vulnerabilities in the station's transceiver software. His findings are published in the next issue of {\it Phrack},\index{Phrack} an electronic periodical for hackers.

Arda's independence letter propagates rapidly over peer to peer networks. Responses on Earth among Terrans following Martian events through independent media are predominantly in favour of the settlement's commitment to independence. Mainstream media sensationalize and relate the situation as a costly mission in crisis with a Mission Commander of questionable intentions and character.

Arda arrives by dirigible at {\it Valles Marineris}, a 4,000 km long canyon reaching up to 7 km in depth. He spends the sol in solitary reflection.

The former NASA had long ago salvaged aluminium recovered in 2001 A.D. from the ruins of the former World Trade Centers in lower Manhattan for reuse in their Mars rover {\it Spirit's} cable shield. To remind future Arcadians of the reasons for independence, Arda has the {\it Constitution} engraved in aluminium recovered from the derelict craft as it came to finally rest at its UNESCO World Heritage Site on Harrowdown Hill, Mars. The plate is kept at Arcadia Hall on public display where it becomes known as the {\it Lamothe Plate} in reverence to the late Dr Richard Lamothe, a renowned Nobel prize winning French astrophysicist, areologist, and author whose every volume is among Arda's private collection.

NASA had originally selected the metal for reuse with {\it Spirit} as a symbol of perseverance in the face of evil. Arda, convinced both the metal and the message it embodied was wanting of further refinement, selected it for reuse in the Lamothe Plate as a symbol of perseverance in the face of tyrrany.

A Survey Team is deployed on a routine assignment using ground based shallow radar to scout for artesian aquifers. Travelling solo, Arda departs Arcadia to rendezvous later with the team as previously scheduled. Midway he performs an EVA to dismount the rover and check one of its tires. While outside, he is knocked from his feet as an explosion occurs on the other side of the rover from within the cabin. Although his forearm is shattered, he sustains no life threatening injuries. With the rover's first aid kit destroyed, he improvises a make shift caste around the suit's elasticized mesh by applying liquid water to solidify coatings of supportive frozen regolith around his forearm.

Arda then inspects the rover to find the cabin fully depressurized and the airlock's seal too badly damaged to maintain positive pressure. The rover's electronic controls are non--responsive, rendering the machine derelict in the middle of a Martian desert. The nearest rescue effort that acknowledges his emergency VHF transponder is an aquifer drilling rig crew at least 42 hours away. With only 35 hours of liquid oxygen available for his respirator, he extends it in time by syphoning cryogenic liquid oxygen from the rover's propulsion system.

The damaged rover is later towed back to a service bay in the city. Senka finds fragments of a pressurized container with a gaseous methane / oxygen signature that had been rated at 35,000 kPa. The mechanics rule out the rover's own equipment since its fuel cells are methanol based and no other known onboard equipment requires methane. 

In an effort to determine who last serviced the vehicle, Senka notes that the electronic maintenance log is missing. Remnants in the cabin of what appear to be fragments of a timer based detonator are recovered with its components not matching any of the rover's equipment.

Arcadia Hall amends the Constitution by passing the {\it Humanoid Act}, stripping corporate legal fictions of the rights of human beings and denying money as a form of free speech. Transplanetaries with registered offices within Arcadia's territorial region do so now without the safety of corporate personhood.

No. \#2 Railgun is taken offline for unscheduled rail and insulator surface repair by Terran UNSA contractor, {\it Solar Urban Moving Systems}. Senka and her Mechanics Team are not informed.

No. \type{#}2 Railgun's blockhouse reports an explosion that has taken out its compulsator power supply. The single largest loss of life ever to occur on Mars unfolds as two--hundred and fifty three people are killed and seven more injured as an adjacent residential district's inflatable dome in Arcadia's Fourth Precinct depressurizes from shrapnel. Henrik rapidly triages the surviving casualties that are rushed to the city's hospital.

Arda convenes an emergency meeting with all state secretaries present at Arcadia Hall. Forensic evidence of a cryobomb's methane / oxygen chemical residue is disclosed. Analysis suggests that at least the detonator is of probable non--Martian origin. 

Before the meeting adjourns, Terran media implicate the alleged identities of the \quote{railgun bombers} as Free Arcadia partisan extremists with ties to Arda.

Shortly after the meeting adjourns, Arda begins reading a presidential address from Arcadia Hall covering his staff's preliminary findings. However, the live broadcast is cutoff prematurely from reaching a Terran audience due to technical difficulties with the {\it Mars Enhanced Telecommunications Orbiter}. Khalid tries to re--establish the uplink but discovers the satellite used to broker nearly all communication between the two planets has been remotely taken offline for an unscheduled systems diagnostic by {\it Bronfman--Murdoch Aerospace} contractors at UNSA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Earth. Terran mainstream media networks reassure Arcadia Hall's Office of the President that Arda's presidential address will be rescheduled for replay later, simultaneous the Terran Superbowl.

Leonard consults with Arda privately and advises him to step down from his political position of President in light of the optics of the situation amidst growing pressure from UNSA back on Earth. However, he maintains that UNSA still backs him in the strictly technical capacity of a Mission Commander due to the influence and respect he carries across the colony, as well as to oversee the immediate resumption of stable deuterium exports. The Governor, as a final suggestion, advises Arda to \quote{dismantle all indigenous self--governance apparatus immediately due to its redundancy with UNSA and its inability to guarantee the safety of the colonists}.

Arda has Arcadia Hall instruct Starport Arcadia to begin fuelling {\it ERV Bravo}, Earth--bound, taking advantage of a minimum--energy launch window. With allegations that Leonard is a NAU--CIA asset, Arda deputizes the first personnel of a newly formed RAP police detachment. He provides authorization for the confiscation, revocation, and destruction of Leonard's visa. A security detail from the detachment takes Leonard into custody where the irate Governor is escorted to the starport. An automated solo departure lifting off later that evening will return him to Earth.

Footage of alleged riots erupting across Arcadia with security forces responding disproportionately are aired across Earth. Mainstream media attribute the alleged riots to grievances held by dissenters at variance with the Free Arcadia partisans. According to the line taken by the networks, the riots began in response to Arcadia Hall's alleged use of force to suppress political dissent in the city. These alleged malcontents and dissenters are coined {\it Red Unionists}\index{Red Unionists}. 

Several critics noting the equivalence of Terran gravity in some of the footage allegedly obtained by citizens in Arcadia are rapidly dismissed by mainstream media as \quote{cranks} and \quote{conspiracy theorists}.
