\StartSection{Workforce & Economy}
What a city can produce, how much it can produce, and what it is capable of producing are largely byproduct of its workforce. The production, import and export of goods, and internal use of the goods make up the cities economy. This section discusses the variety of workforces, what they represent, how they are created and maintained, and what they are capable of. It also deals with a cities income and expenditures and how these are managed by the player.  

\StartSubSection{Workforce}
All objects and buildings are produced by a form of labour, what this is may change with technology or player choice, but this labour force must be able to a) exist, and b) travel to or exist at a production location.

A workforce is essentially another resource of either population or technology that needs to be either educated or built on a variety of levels and scales. Therefore its creation, maintainence, and control needs to be carefully managed by the player. A labour workfoce requires certain factors to bring it into fruition which may include a certain level of education, access to work, and perhaps even restrictions to to certain aspects of these. An intellectual workforce requires different factors to develop then a manual labour workforce. While the two are not mutually exclusive, it might become more difficult to create multiple classes in a single city. For discussions sake, workforce includes all labour factors driving the economy and extends to consumers (and even the homeless, criminals, and the unemployed). How people are raised, educated, and conditioned through experience largely determines their consumer patterns and may be reflected in a population's consumer choices.

Workforce is a dynamic resource that can move globally. If your workforce requires cheap housing and this becomes easier to gain in another city, many may migrate to this city seeking better opportunities. Likewise, they can move within your city to different opportunities. The movement within a city can be controlled to an extent to enable better or worse access to certain locations, increasing and decreasing travel time, or diverting travel for other means (likewise a workforce of machines can be moved with expense or stationary as in a production plant). Workforce is made up of many individual entities. A cities multi layered workforce is actually made up of varying amounts (many thousands) of individual workers known as entities. These workers, human, animal, and mechanical, are depicted visually by people or objects performing tasks or moving around the city.

%Workforce Bases
There are different fundamental types of workforce. There is a robotic/mechanical workforce, a human/biological/social workforce, and animal/biological workforce. These are known as workforce bases. The mechanical workforce requires research and development into avenues such as robotics and mechanical engineering with a social system in place requiring either the development of these to the eventual production and acceptance or the import of these and the acceptance by the population. The human workforce alternative is made up of human labour performing the tasks required by the society, and the animal workfroce is similar to this. Aspects of these may be accepted to varying degrees also. Cities in Avaneya may also have a mix of these three workforce systems, indeed most will. In addition to a city producing its own workforce, it may purchase machinery, attract population, and hire individuals directly from other cities. While the city itself may purchase sometimes, the actually purchasing of individuals and machinery may take place by businesses. A cities governing player is primarily responsible for creating opportunities which can keep trained persons in the city or attracting such persons from cities. 

There will be underlying conditions that will determine what a cities workforce is comprised of and players will have certain degress of influence over the direction the workforce takes but if certain conditions aren't met the citizenry may not accept or appreciate the current workforce type with the vary consequences of innaction being varried. How players make these conditions and the direction they take with there workforce is a choice made in the sandbox style of play, it is a creation. They can create anything from human/animal labour pool to complete nanocracies with robotic workforces and humans indulging in deccandent pleasure palaces. The player can manage his city through inacting certain ordinance, directing funds, and other general city management processes including placement of civic buildings and diplomacy. 


\StartSubSection{Workforce Entities}
As mentioned briefly above a cities workforce is made up of many individual entities. Each entity can be a part of various workforce types however only the human workforce has needs which differentiates them from other the other two workforce bases. The reason for giving human needs and not other workforce groups is that human interact with the players decisions, political or otherwise. Animals and machine are only effected by ordinance and taxation through humans. 

The needs an entity, or individual human, has determine where it will go, what it will do, and how it will do it. If we take sections [] accuracy into account we can view humans in a largely tabula rasa state, with no ill will except to maintain there own needs. Further to this, it can be seen that the nature in which human interact and the means in which they satisfy their needs is determined by something outside of there biological state. 

The human needs consist of:
oxygen: breathable air, a human can survive for less than 3 minutes without suffering potentially serious consequences. 

water: clean drinking water. The human body can survive upto a week without water (provided good conditions). 

food: sustainence and nutrtion. It is essential to not only have something to eat but that it contains the various essential nutrients to support human life. A human can last several weeks without food provided they have water.

security: shelter/housing, feeling safe in surroundings, and feeling secure about the future.

belonging: feeling of making a contribution, having people to talk to, being a part of something more than hirself.

In light of the above paragraphs, it can be seen that it is quite simple to satisfy a humans security needs. However, continually bombard hir with messages of insecurity and threats despite evidence to the contrary and it will seek ever greater means to satisfy this need, perhaps waging unnecessary wars against otherwise peaceful peoples. This is just an example of how a player can create or solve disonance in human needs and scenarios the game can implement to challenge players.



\StartSubsection{workforce Types}
The dynamic and multifaceted nature of workforce may become more evident when reading about the various workforce types. From the list below it can be seen that workforce comprises what the population is doing in reaction to the cities governance or that of other cities.

Attributes of a workforce can overlap. An aspect of workforce could be tertiary educated but unemplyed, or a physical labourer with a secondary education. Also individuals may move between workforce types, as in moving through education levels or going from unemployed to employed. Some factors which change workforce types are done through time, other done through city management.

Some types of workforce are easy to maintain in a state desired by players, such as industrial machinery. This needs only to be created, maintained, and given a source of power. Other workforce types are more specific such as "the high school teacher" or "motor mechanic". These require specific circumstances surrounding a population, with just the right levels of affluence and education. Whats more is human based workforce types also share needs with other types and are dependant on eachother to provide those needs. This makes for a complex array of interaction between workforces, and when combined with taxation levels, ordinance, and geopolitical factors the complexitity is multiplied.


%Workforce Types
-Homeless
-Unemployed
-Physical labour (varying levels/classes, ie production, mining)
-Education (primary, secondary, tertiary, post tertiary [not complete, see education types])
-Employment skill (varying types depending on field, ie years of experience)
-Training (varying types, ie separate training that a business or government may provide)
-Criminal (varying types)
-Militia
-Consumer (varying types depending on influences, ie social eco status, cultural)
-Mechanical (varying) 
-Protester
-animal
-age

%Thinking of giving players micro management control of the education system if they choose.





\StartSubSection{Influencing Human Workforce}
There are various methods in which the human workforces are influenced to take a certain direction. The main method in which a player can influence his own or someone elses workforce is through economic means such as taxation or ordinance, although other methods may exist such as brute force or through environmental coercion. Additional methods include the use of the media and/or propaganda which can be initialized by the player, another player, or AI representing Earth interests.

The means in which the workforce itself is influenced is through their various needs. Human workforce entities will go about striving to fulfill there needs (discussed above) by any means necessary. Usually this is somewhat peaceful but depends on the situation at hand at player/s influence. Through enacting ordinance, taxation, and various diplomatic relations the player creates variance in the workforce needs levels. 

An example may be the implementation of a higher tax level for a certain group of people. This may place strain on there income, causing crime, violence, and other problems for the city. However if this higher tax level is offset with social funding for this group, giving them other means to obtain there needs then the previous situation with crime level increase may not occur. 

Another example is placing allowing television and private broadcast. While cheaper for the government and good for business, this system may become abused with continually broadcasts leaving people feeling that their belongingness need is to be fulfilled by wearing the same clothes as some Earth celebrity. 

The above two examples are simple occurances. In avaneya there will be multiple levels of cultural and economic variance to deal with to keep all aspects of the city functioning while still trying to achieve player goals such as technological innovation and maintain an independent yet peaceful existance with Earth. From this it can be seen the the AI of human workforce will be quite involved.   

%Discuss how effected and how entities will react.
The AI of entities will respond to a variety of inputs from the greater enviroment. The manner in which each entity attempts to reach satisfaction of its needs is determined from this environmental input. To describe the process, an individual entity will go about in its default state provided it has access to all its essentials. When this access is threatened or blocked it will attempt to right the situation by some means. The means in which it can right the situation depends on the enviroment, namely economic, political, and location factors, as well as its education/knowledge and social status, and the need that is being threatened. Further to this, an entity may not even be aware of some changes or threats and therefore mighht not take action
%will the entity know this or not? What is the limit to entity taking action or not?

Lets go back to our example on a threat to security. One human workforce type might make business deals to get it out of the city or off the planet. Another might petition government to increase militia spending. Another might encourage the people to take to arms and fight. And another might join the militia. Outliers may take to vigilante justic or investigate to discover possible conspiracies. Of course the degree to which these can occur depend largely on previous player input to the population.

There is a multitude of means in which entities will respond to player sitations that threaten or improve their circumstances, and these are unique to the need being effected.

%multiple threats to multiple needs
When there are multiple threats to the same entity, it will respond in order of importance. Clearly, air, then water, then food, then security, then belonging. Entities will not respond to their need to belond when they are dieing from lack of oxygen.
