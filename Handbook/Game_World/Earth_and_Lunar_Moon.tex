\StartSection{Earth & Lunar Moon}

Most of Earth falls within one of ten geopolitical entities or unions. These include the African Union, Asian Pacific Union, Asian Union, Caribbean Union, Central American Union, European Union, Gulf Union, Mediterranean Union, North American Union, and the South American Union. Portions of their history and circumstance can be derived from reading the leading character biographies in \in{chapter}[Leading Characters] as well as the fictional timeline in \in{chapter}[Timeline].

As for Earth's lunar moon, it does not play a significant role in Avaneya's gameplay yet. It does, however, contain lucrative helium--3 mines.
