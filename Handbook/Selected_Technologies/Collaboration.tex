\head {\em Bzr}

We use Bzr for all revision control management. Our development model favours the {\it cathedral} approach, rather than the {\it bazaar}. For a project like this, we feel it is most appropriate because of the amount of coordination necessary to produce a high quality game. For more information on the rationale behind why we chose Bzr over its many counterparts, see \in{section}[Rationale for Bzr].

\head {\em Internet Relay Chat (IRC)}

We use IRC for realtime communication over the internet. For more information on how we use IRC, see \in{section}[Internet Relay Chat].
