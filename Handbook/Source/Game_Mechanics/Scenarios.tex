Scenarios are at the heart of Avaneya. They can be played through the custom mode, enjoyed with your friends over a LAN, or experienced through the campaign mode (which is itself a series of scenarios). These scenarios seek not only to entertain, but also to inform by drawing upon issues in the environmental, social, political, economic, agricultural, and other realms. But each scenario is never really strictly one and nothing of all others. As an example, the issue of water privatization is relevant to a discussion in at least all of the aforementioned. That is why scenarios can incorporate multiple objectives. These objectives, depending on how the scenario is scripted, can lead to the user having successfully completed the scenario.

Let us take a look now at some of the objectives a scenario can be constructed with.
