\StartChapter{Preface}

Avaneya is a cerebral science fiction game targeted towards users of the GNU operating system.\footnotecite[gnu_users_who_have_never_heard_of_gnu] This guide is intended for Avaneya's ever growing community of contributors who would like to get involved in this very exciting project.

This document will continue to be revised and improved. Therefore, please use a direct \href{\LatestHandbookURL}{link} to the always current revision within our project's set of blueprints rather than an outdated local copy. We will discuss blueprints further later in \in{section}[Blueprints].

This handbook has several purposes:

\startitemize[4]
\item
To encourage contributors to refine their ideas, think them through, and commit them to paper where their ideas are available for deliberation and public review;

\item
To define the project as clearly as possible within a single, consolidated, canonical location so contributors have something to reference;

\item
To politely prevent current contributors from having to explain things when their explanations are already contained within this book;\footnote[rtfm]{It is a good idea to ask questions, but as we say in the hacker community, always read the documentation first.}

\item
Lastly, to let the odd naysayer that we did indeed undertake thoughtful due diligence, that the project was not simply \quote{tavern talk}, and that we are prepared to see it through to completion.
\stopitemize

Spoiler Alert! This book is intended for contributors in our community, and may not be as appropriate for players Avaneya. Indeed, the guide may spoil elements of the game. Consider yourself warned. 

On the other hand, players of Avaneya are just as likely to enrich this game through constructive feedback. This feedback is best buttressed with the well-informed understanding of the project that this book can provide.
