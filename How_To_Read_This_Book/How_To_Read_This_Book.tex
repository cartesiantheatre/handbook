\StartChapter{How To Read This Book}

It should not be necessary for anyone to feel compelled to read this whole book. Big books can be intimidating, but this one you'll hopefully have fun with. 

Specific portions are intended for specific audiences. A reader in the general case does not need to be familiar with every aspect of this creative and technical endeavour any more so than we should expect anyone in theatre to be informed in {\it all} aspects of stage lighting, acoustics, pyrotechnics, carpentry, acting, costume design, costing, and management.

Having said that, readers have nothing to lose in exploring as much or as little as they like. We tried to efficiently organize the material in such a way that anyone taking the scenic route might benefit the most when explored in the order the chapters were presented. However, if you happen to be a contributor, some portions will probably be of greater interest than others.

If you want to walk away with the big picture in the least amount of time, we encourage you to read chapters \in[Leitmotifs], \in[The Game], \in[Leading Characters], and \in[Timeline].

With all of that out of the way, on we go!
