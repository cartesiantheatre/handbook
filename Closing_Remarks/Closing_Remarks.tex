This was a difficult book to write. It forced us to commit our thoughts to paper. This caused us to reflect, examine, redesign, and refine them as they came out.

On behalf of all of us, we would like to extend our gratitude for your having taken the time to study this project comprehensively. Avaneya has an exciting future ahead of it. We hope that you will choose to be a part of it.
