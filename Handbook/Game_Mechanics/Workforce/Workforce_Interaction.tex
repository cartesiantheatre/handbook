%How families are formed
%How groups are formed
%Groups being companies
%Businesses as groups


%Notes so far:
Units together doing things form group bubbles (bubbles is just a descriptor at this stage).
Units move between groups throughout day/time. 
They enter groups to fulfil needs, act on interests, or out of routine (whatever routine is).
Group 'bubbles' grow and shrink as units come and go.
Units who enter work group/business group contribute to productivity. 

Group types - as in family, work, etc:
Family, living, support
Work, company, productivity
Friends, interests, fun, belonging
