\StartChapter{Timeline}
\startlines

The world Avaneya takes place in is highly self-referential. A fictional timeline is positioned relative to a {\it year zero\index{year zero}}, with years preceding suffixed {\it B.R.\index{B.R.}}, before the republic; while those following are suffixed {\it A.R.\index{A.R.}}, after the republic. This is the method adopted by \goto{Arda}[Arda Baştürk] and his settlers around the time they declare their independence.

Note that a year is defined as a Martian year (MYr) and is not the same as a Terran year. You may want to refer to \in{section}[Time] for a detailed explanation on how the settlers keep track of time on Mars.

Year zero's placement relative to the Gregorian calendar\index{Gregorian calendar} is deliberately never explicitly given. But inferentially, one can reason it is proximate enough for a contemporary audience to feel relevant, yet distant enough to afford some creative license. As said earlier, Avaneya may take place in the future, yet it deals with contemporary issues.

NASA's {\it Zubrin} spacecraft lifts off atop a 140 tonne capable Enigma-D heavy-lift booster from its launchpad at Cape Canaveral, North American Union. The manned module separates from the booster in low Earth orbit. It carries a crew of four with two flight engineers and two mechanics with combined specialities in geology and biogeochemistry. This is the first attempted piloted mission to Mars, implementing the Mars Direct mission architecture as a direct launch. Its objective is to determine primarily if the Red Planet ever harboured life, as well as to survey and explore.

In addition, thousands of scientists, engineers, and philosophers attend as either independent presenters or as part of any number of associations ranging from former Case For Mars conference members to The American Astronautical Society, NASA, the RAND Corporation, and others.

The minimalistic Mars Direct\footnote{See \about[Mars Direct] for more information on Mars Direct.} approach of travelling light, living off of the land, and using indigenous materials to produce the fuel necessary for the journey home is again a central theme, but with more emphasis on the nature of the duration on Mars and material infrastructure required.

The International Mars Summit concludes and publishes its findings in the {\it Report on the International Proceedings of the Mars Summit}. The report contains the following:

\startTimelineDocument
Zero capability missions have no value. The Mars Direct mission, having already demonstrated successfully the feasibility of sending humans to Mars, the bar now can and ought to be raised. The attendees concluded nearly unanimously that it is not prudent to return merely for the sake of demonstrating that a safe return is possible, that having already been established, but to create a permanent settlement on Mars. 

A suitable upper Amazonian geologically classified region where the presence of underground liquid water reservoirs has already been observed is a strong candidate location. 

Such a mission architecture would primarily provide unique, cutting edge, off world, research facilities to address major global issues afflicting all nations. Secondarily, it would also serve to bootstrap the first non-terrestrial expansion of human civilization. Both of these goals are in the service of all mankind.
\stopTimelineDocument

The report's abstract outline for a new mission architecture is as follows:

\startitemize[n]
\item Deploy a space station in low Earth orbit to act as a construction berth for trans-Martian spacecraft supplied by efficient single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles.

\item Launch a spacecraft constructed within the space station that would transport only the minimum necessary to bootstrap a settlement, such as cryogenic \chemical{H_2} needed to initiate the \goto{Sabatier}[Sabatier Reactor] and \goto{RWGS}[Reverse Water Gas Shift Reactor] reactors to produce fuel and oxygen, {\it in situ}, respectively, a nuclear reactor, excavation equipment, and additional equipment.

\item Use a chemical propulsion system of \chemical{H_2/O_2} to get to Mars, then use indigenous resources to supply the return propellant of \chemical{CH_4/O_2}. This requires the mission payload to include propellant for the outbound trans-Martian injection stage only.

\item The crew would deploy construction equipment and machinery to process indigenous materials to create the {\it Arcadian Settlement}, a permanent outpost located in the Arcadia Planitia region and falling within a United Nations extraterritorial mandate.

\item The spacecraft would return to Earth unmanned, but fully fuelled with {\it in situ} produced methane/oxygen propellant. This would allow subsequent shipments to depart Earth bearing spare parts, machinery, additional excavation equipment, and whatever else the outpost could not have determined necessary {\it a priori}.

\item Personnel ferries departing Earth at regular intervals would continue to augment the settlement capability through providing additional manpower. This would increase the number of available habitats, greenhouses, and other vital infrastructure necessary to support the research being conducted.
\stopitemize

A preliminary draft of the {\it Mars Treaty} is produced using a revised {\it Outer Space Treaty} of 1967 A.D. as an adaptable boilerplate. The treaty provides the contractual basis for all signatories, outlining the road map, responsibilities, and party resource allocations necessary to bring about the terraformation and first manned mission to Mars operating under a United Nations mandate. The treaty also provides an agreement governing the activities of states on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

The terraformation strategy is to be initiated by intercepting {\it 52048 Varuna} with a nuclear warhead and deflecting it into a Martian collision trajectory. Being a C-type asteroid, it contains high levels of hydrated (water-containing) minerals which, when released into the atmosphere as aerosols, have been calculated to greatly increase the total available cloud condensation nuclei.

Data was presented at the summit predicting that the direct effect of the introduction of these new, dark, carbonaceous, aerosols would be a decrease in \goto{albedo}[Albedo] since they absorb more solar radiation. This would cause a cascading series of reactions, resulting in increases in the mean surface temperature and atmospheric pressure.

The deflection strategy, if executed as calculated, would have the asteroid impact directly over the Martian south pole. The south pole contains a large sheet of buried \chemical{CO_2} (dry ice) approximately 8 metres thick which, when sublimated, would theoretically act as a powerful greenhouse gas, thickening the atmosphere, along with the underlying water ice beneath it.

While the legalities of the project are defined in the {\it Mars Treaty}, the international collaborative project it implicates is known as the {\it Avaneya Initiative}.
\StopTimelineDate

\StartTimelineDate{B.R.}
{\it United Nations General Assembly Resolution 5571} is adopted, ratifying the Mars Treaty. The resolution augments {\it Chapter III} of the {\it United Nations Charter} to beget its seventh principle organ, the {\it Space Agency} (UNSA). Its mandate reifies the treaty, overseeing the implementation of the Avaneya Initiative.

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs\index{United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs} (UNOOSA\index{UNOOSA}) is dissolved. The former responsibilities that it held since its formation in 1958 A.D. are amalgamated under the new UNSA.

The resolution requires members to accede state space agencies, such as the North American Union Aeronautical and Space Agency (NAUSA), European Space Agency (ESA), Asian Aerospace Exploration Agency (AAXA), and others under a centralized UNSA administration. The public rationale given that space exploration and settlement ought to be an endeavour for all mankind, best realized through the cooperative aggregation of resources.

Lieberman is nominated to the Office of the President of the UNSA, resigning his position as director for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

UNSA's Office of the Avaneya Initiative announces successful bids. The {\it Iterum Shipyard} contract is jointly awarded to Lockheed Martin-Boeing and Mercedes-Pratt & Whitney to robotically build a station remotely in low Earth orbit at a cost of 2.2 billion bancors. The station is to be used as a general purpose interplanetary space vehicle construction platform.

% Lockheed Martin's failed X-33 design would be a good starting point for a model...
% TODO: Get the Sanskrit devangari characters to display some how...
Lockheed Martin-Boeing is awarded a contract to provide three, leased, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO), manned, re-usable, {\it VentureStar VII} class suborbital spaceplanes. These vehicles, known as {\it Aravans},\footnote{Sanskrit अरवन् for a steed or horse.} provide UNSA with heavy lift workhorses for ferrying personnel and materials to the {\it Iterum Shipyard}. They require no external solid booster rockets or external fuel tanks and each operate at less than a fifth of the cost of the retired Space Shuttles.

Lockheed Martin-Boeing is also awarded 21 billion bancors worth of contracts to incrementally provide four direct-launch to Mars {\it Tarikin}\footnote{Sanskrit तरीकिन for a ferry-man.} ferries capable of carrying payloads of 150 personnel each, plus provisions. The {\it Tarikins} will shuttle settlers to Mars using a chemical \chemical{H_2/O_2} propulsion system for the outbound trajectory, but then provided in Martian orbit with the return \chemical{CH_4/O_2} propellant manufactured {\it in situ}. The {\it Tarkins} will depart Earth every 780 day minimum-energy launch window, taking 180 days to arrive at Mars in constant rotation with each other.

Mitsubishi-Saab's is awarded a contract to robotically construct {\it Avaneya} remotely within the {\it Iterum Shipyard} orbital berth at a cost of 7.8 billion bancors. {\it Avaneya} will carry the bootstrap crew and large amounts of construction equipment.

Volvo-John Deere is awarded a contract to provide chemical propulsion systems for {\it Avaneya}, {\it Aravans}, and {\it Tarikins} at a cost of 920 million bancors. It is used for the outbound trans-Martian trajectory, with the return methane/oxygen (\chemical{CH_4/O_2}) propellant manufactured {\it in situ}.

Carlyle Holding's Soros-Murdoch Aerospace is awarded a contract to provide four {\it Mars Positioning System} satellites and the {\it Mars Enhanced Telecommunications Orbiter} carrying an optical relay and other instrumentation at a cost of 750 million bancors.

Arcadia's greatest achievement occurred today with its realization that it can do better, that Earth has nothing that it needs, and that it will not follow in its example. We had arrived on Mars under the impression that we had left Earth, only to find ourselves still steeped in the very worst of it. The era of plundering the fruits of the Red Horn of Plenty to the detriment of those who laboured tirelessly and assumed all of the greatest dangers is over. Today we made plans to truly depart Earth and with no thought of return.

Arda advances his speech noting the passage that morning of the {\it Rubicon Act}, initiating steps to secure the settlement's independence and begetting the first non-terrestrial autonomous city-state through self-declared legislation, also known as the {\it Constitution of the Republic of Arcadia Planitia}. Notable portions are summarized:

\startTimelineDocument
\startitemize[5]
\setupwhitespace[big]
\item {\it Article I} declares the colony an independent, sovereign, self-governed, constitutional republic with the right to self determination. It is self-styled the {\it Republic of Arcadia Planitia (RAP)}, colloquially known by its capital and sole city, {\it Arcadia}.

\item {\it Article II} defines the head of state, the {\it Executor}. The Executor and cabinet ministers are democratically elected and serve for as long as the electorate permit.

\item {\it Article III} discharges all public debt held by the {\it International Monetary Fund} and the {\it World Bank} effective immediately, ending the Terran central banks' use of the settlers' registered biological property, their birth certificates, as collateral against a debt that preceded their arrival on Mars.

%\item {\it Article IV} defines the state's rule as predicated upon natural law and not positive law, limiting the state's mandate exclusively to the preservation of life, liberty, property, and rights.
\item {\it Article VII} superannuates the Terran \goto{\it bancor}[Bancor] fiat currency with the \goto{\it jenya}[Jenya]. The jenya is declared the exclusive legal tender within the Republic, necessitating all Terran interests to acquire Arcadian goods and services in jenyas only.

\item {\it Article VIII} defines the state's relation to a military. Militias are permitted, but conditional upon executive authority exclusively vested in none other than the people. The creation of a permanent standing army at the government's disposal is strictly forbidden.

The militia's three restrictions are that it is forbidden from deployment outside of Arcadia's territorial regions, that its purpose is exclusively defensive - of people, not of government, and that it cannot be deployed domestically as an aid to civil power under any circumstance.

\item {\it Article IX} denies the deployment of munitions of war, suborbital, orbital, in outer space, or anywhere outside of Arcadia's territorial region.

\item {\it Articles XI to XXVII} enumerate the fundamental freedoms and human rights Arcadians enjoy with respect to their new state. They are adapted from Earth's former {\it European Convention on Human Rights}.

\item {\it Article XXIX} prohibits the state from providing itself with a not-withstanding clause, preventing a legal override of any part of the Act.

UNSA has the NAUSA JPL lock down all four {\it Mars Positioning Satellites} in anticipation of RAP denial-of-service attacks.

All solnet communications between Earth and Mars that had been brokered by METO are now unavailable. The orbiter had also been used for reliable inter-Arcadian use. Arcadians adapt in its absence with a combination of line-of-sight UHF and shortwave communication.

{\it Yama's} launch window is missed due to low-Earth orbit overly saturated with space debris. UNSA engineers fear they may be approaching the Kessler effect of causing a runaway chain reaction which would reduce all objects in orbit. This would threaten {\it Iterum Shipyard} and all Terran space exploration. Departure is rescheduled for the next appropriate launch window of 25 months.

{\it Yama} completes its trans-Martian journey, aerobreaking into Martian geostationary orbit. The ship carries a payload of remotely operated equipment destined for Phobos, a photographic reconnaissance satellite for sun-synchronous orbit, as well as a single Rapid Reaction Force battalion. The battalion is to be deployed as the {\it United Nations Emergency Assistance Peacekeeping Force}. Its numbers are drawn principally from North American Union and European Union airborne light infantry units.

{\it Arcadia Planitia} comes under fire by orbital shelling, marking the first off-world shots ever fired in anger. {\it Arcadia Hall} is successfully targeted and destroyed, though most of Arcadia is deliberately left intact. Outside of the city, all locations of the suspected underground RAP installation are hammered over the next month.

Between shellings, Arda has the systems team erect a high-gain directional antenna which circumvents the need for a satellite communication relay to transmit to Earth in a rudimentary manner. He discloses directly over S-band microwave to the people of Earth what is happening on Mars, describing the UNSA shelling campaign as an attack on peaceful and defenceless civilians levied from a robotically operated orbital installation. He claims that the installation which had been kept from the public's knowledge is on and within the porous Martian moon Phobos. High resolution photographs of the {\it Thor Outpost} accompany the transmission as evidence.

Arda explains that by exploiting a legal loophole in the {\it Outer Space Treaty}, the {\it Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty}, and the {\it Mars Treaty} whose drafting predated the advent of kinetic bombardment weapons, UNSA believes it is justified in dropping hypersonic tungsten rods with surgical precision at downward velocities of 10 km/s on the surface. The treaties do not observe kinetic bombardment as weapons of mass destruction since they require no explosive payload, though they deliver sufficient kinetic energy in the order of a small tactical nuclear weapon.

The transmission is picked up on Earth by amateur radio operators and quickly disseminated over solnet. UNSA dismisses Arda's claims as {\it "baseless allegations propagated by Terran conspiracy theorists used to justify the theft and reckless destruction of the costly off-world public asset of the Arcadian Settlement"}. A UNSA spokesman refuses to respond to questions on the existence of any Phobos based installation.

A subsonic aircraft crashes 40 km south of RAP Starport carrying 3600 kg of cocaine in the plains of {\it Arcadia Planitia}. The Ministry of Transportation's investigators confirm that the aircraft's tailnumber was registered to the CIA for alleged UNSA diplomatic flights. Chemical analysis suggests it to be the first known synthetic cocaine and of Martian origin.
