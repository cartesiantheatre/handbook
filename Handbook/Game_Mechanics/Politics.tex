\StartSection{Politics}

This section deals with the various aspects of Avaneya's political systems from diplomatic interactions between players to a cities populations interaction with eachother and the player as well as the population initiated political systems. 


\StartSubsection{Population Politics}
The politcal system in Avaneya aims to add to the player imersion and depth of experiece, this is paramount and cannot be compromised. In addition the implementing of any population driving politcal system in which actual workforce units have a say in government policy cannot inhibit the player's creativity and ability to build and implement strategies she see's as appropriate.

The primary aim of a politcal system chosen by the population is to add a depth of mechanical complexity that is mindblowing while being a streamline experience for the player. With this, a player's actions and decisions will affect not just his population but his ability to manage and govern the city in his chosen direction.

See Subsection "Influencing Human Workforce" in workforce.tex (which needs more detail)

Through various influences on the human workforce such as the style in which the education system is setup the workforce will gain interests which can correspond with those exhibited by a politcal group. Several factors must align for a unit to "vote" for a representative:
-there must be a vote
-the unit must be able to vote
-the unit either is compelled to vote by some degree or threshold of interests or voting is compulsory






%What entity is the politcal group and how is this interacting with the player?

%Players influence on people making government type or broad ideals that match a governer.
%Players 



%eg player makes decision that create a certain population type who then vote in a minister/representative person who is hard line pro polluting industry which means any attempt by the player to close industry is met with hostilty... (what hostility?)  

%Workforce types deciding on political system
%Players don't choose heads of state or political system, players can influence political system and change through the development of cultures and workforce types.
