You'll need ConTeXt Minimal installed to build the handbook. Here are
instructions for installing it from source on a variety of different
platforms:

    <http://wiki.contextgarden.net/ConTeXt_Minimals>

If you are running Ubuntu, Adam Reviczky <adam.reviczky@kcl.ac.uk> 
was kind enough to provide us with a PPA. Consider yourself warned,
however, that Adam's build recipe pulls from the latest upstream
source on a daily basis which means ConTeXt may work one day and
possibly busted to shit on another. You'll need both his ConTeXt
and LuaTeX PPA's available:

    <https://launchpad.net/~reviczky/+archive/context-daily>
    <https://launchpad.net/~reviczky/+archive/luatex-daily>

You will also need some support packages. To do all of the above on Ubuntu, run 
the following:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:reviczky/context-daily
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:reviczky/luatex-daily
    $ sudo aptitude update
    $ sudo aptitude install     \
        umbrello                \
        texlive-math-extra      \
        texlive-latex-extra     \
        ttf-ubuntu-font-family  \
        context                 \
        context-extra           \
        context-fonts-extra     \
        graphviz                \
        pdftk                   \
        inkscape

Once you have the dependencies installed, simply run the following 
within Avaneya/Documentation/Contributors/Handbook:

    $ make

If everything went well, you should have the Avaneya Project Crew Handbook.pdf 
sitting in the aforementioned folder ready to go.

If your context or luatex packages ever are upgraded, Adam recommends you do the
following.

    * Update packages (e.g. aptitude upgrade)
    * remove ~/.texmf-var
    * run: luatools --generate
    * run: mtxrun --generate
    * run: context --make
    * run: context --make cont-en cont-nl
    * run: mtxrun --script fonts --reload
    * run: context hello.tex
        ...with hello.tex being just:

        \starttext
        Hello world!
        \stoptext
