\StartChapter{Leading Characters}

Avaneya's leading characters are drawn from a variety of places on Earth. This is to be expected of any space program with an international flavour. Nearly all of those deployed to Mars in the initial landing have strong scientific backgrounds in their respective fields.

All of the characters' personalities can and should be revealed indirectly whenever possible. This may be through body language, object symbolism, or the circumstance of the events they participate in. Whenever more direct means are appropriate, a character's own writings or their participation in a dialogue are possibilities as well.

The leading figure and protagonist, Arda Baştürk, ought to be the game's most recognizable character. He is described below in \in{section}[Arda Baştürk].
