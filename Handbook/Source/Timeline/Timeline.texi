@chapter Timeline

The world Avaneya takes place in is highly self-referential. A fictional timeline is positioned relative to a @dfn{year zero}, with dates preceding suffixed @dfn{B.R.}, before the republic; while those following are suffixed @dfn{A.R.}, after the republic. This is the method adopted by Arda and his settlers. 

Note that a year is defined as a Martian year (MYr) and is not the same as a Terran year. You may want to refer to @ref{Game World Time} for a more detailed explanation on how the settlers keep track of time on Mars.

The year zero's placement relative to the Gregorian calendar is deliberately never given. But inferentially, one can reason that it is proximate enough for a contemporary audience to still feel relevant, yet distant enough to afford some reasonable creative licenses.

@b{15 Sep 35 B.R.} The United Nations holds the International Mars Summit in Geneva, Switzerland, with the purpose of discussing the options on the table for the first manned mission to Mars. The attendees represent the African Union, North American Union, European Union, Asian Union, along with thousands of scientists, engineers, philosophers, and other scholars from around the world. The minimalistic Mars Direct approach of travelling light, living off of the land, and using indigenous materials to produce the fuel necessary for the journey home is a central theme.

@item
@b{12 Oct 35 B.R.} The International Mars Summit concludes publishing its findings in the @dfn{Mars Report}: @i{"Although the Mars Direct approach is totally feasible, the bar can and should be pushed. The summit determined that it is best to go, not merely for the sake of demonstrating that a safe return is possible, but to establish a permanent settlement on Mars. The purpose being to bootstrap the first non-terrestrial expansion of human civilization for the benefit of all mankind."}

A preliminary draft of the @dfn{Mars Treaty} is produced using a revised @i{Outer Space Treaty} of 1967 A.D. as a basis for a subset of it. The treaty provides the contractual basis for all signatories, outlining the roadmap, responsibilities, and party resource allocations necessary to serve as a vehicle for the terraformation and first manned mission to Mars operating under a United Nations mandate. The treaty also provides an agreement governing the activities of states on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos. 

The terraformation strategy is to be initiated by intercepting @i{52048 Varuna} and deflecting it to directly impact Mars using a nuclear warhead. Being a C-type asteroid, it contains high levels of hydrated (water-containing) minerals which, when released into the atmosphere, will greatly increase cloud condensation nuclei. Data was presented at the summit predicting a dramatic [increase / decreasing] in albedo, the proportion of sunlight reflected back into space. This would cause a cascading series of reactions, increasing the mean surface temperature and atmospheric pressure.

This international project implicated by the treaty is termed the @dfn{Avaneya Initiative}.

@item
@b{22 Oct 34 B.R.} @dfn{United Nations General Assembly Resolution 5571} is adopted making the Mars Treaty ratified. The resolution augments @i{Chapter III} of the @i{United Nations Charter} to beget its seventh principle organ, the @dfn{Space Agency} (UNSA). It is bestowed with a mandate enacting the treaty, and by implication, the Avaneya Initiative.

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) is dissolved. Its former responsibilities are transferred to UNSA under its new mandate.

The resolution also requires members to accede the North American Union Aeronatical and Space Agency (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA), Asian Aerospace Exploration Agency (AAXA), and all other national member space agencies under centralized UNSA administration. This is granted under the justification that space exploration and settlement ought to be an endeavour for all mankind, best realized through the aggregation of resources.

Lieberman is nominated to the Office of the President of the UNSA, resigning his position as director for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The @dfn{Iterum Shipyard} contract is jointly awarded to Lockheed Martin-Boeing and Mercedes-Pratt & Whitney to build a station in low Earth orbit at a cost of 2.2 billion bancors. The station is to be used as a general purpose interplanetary space vehicle construction platform.

Lockheed Martin-Boeing is awarded a contract to provide three, leased, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO), manned, re-usable, @dfn{VentureStar VII} suborbital spaceplanes. These spaceplanes provide UNSA with heavy lift workhorses for transporting personnel and materials to the Iterum Station. They require no external solid booster rockets or external fuel tank and each operate at less than @math{{1 / 5}^{th} } the cost of the long retired Space Shuttle predecessor.

Mitsubishi-Saab's is awarded a contract to provide the @dfn{Avaneya}, constructed @i{in situ}, at the @i{Iterum Shipyard}, at a cost of 7.8 billion bancors.
