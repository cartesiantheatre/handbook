\StartChapter{Timeline}
\startlines

The world Avaneya takes place in is highly self-referential. A fictional timeline is positioned relative to a {\it year zero\index{year zero}}, with years preceding suffixed {\it B.R.\index{B.R.}}, before the republic; while those following are suffixed {\it A.R.\index{A.R.}}, after the republic. This is the method adopted by Arda and his settlers around the time they declared their independence. But independent of that, they still reference hours, days, and months as described in \in{section}[Time].

Note that a year is defined as a Martian year (MYr) and is not the same as a Terran year. You may want to refer to \in{section}[Time] for a more detailed explanation on how the settlers keep track of time on Mars.

Year zero's placement relative to the Gregorian calendar\index{Gregorian calendar} is deliberately never given. But inferentially, one can reason it is proximate enough for a contemporary audience to feel relevant, yet distant enough to afford some creative licenses.

NASA's {\it Zubrin} spacecraft lifts off atop an Enigma-D heavy-lift booster from its launchpad at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Its 140 tonnes capability separates from the manned module in low Earth orbit. It carries a crew of four with two flight engineers and two mechanics with combined specialities in geology and biogeochemistry. This is the first attempted piloted mission to Mars and implements the Mars Direct mission architecture as a direct launch. Its objective is to determine primarily if the Red Planet ever harboured life, as well as to survey and explore.

\startTimelineDocument
"Zero capability missions have no value. The Mars Direct mission having demonstrated successfully the feasibility of sending humans to Mars, the bar now can and should be pushed. The attendees concluded unanimously that it is not prudent to return merely for the sake of demonstrating that a safe return is possible, that having already been established, but to create a permanent settlement on Mars in a suitable region geologically classified as upper Amazonian where the presence of underground liquid water reservoirs have been identified. The new mission architecture proposed would be designed to bootstrap the first non-terrestrial expansion of human civilization for the benefit of all mankind."
\stopTimelineDocument
\crlf

The plan's abstract outline is as such:

{\bf Phase I:} 

\startitemize[n]
\item Create a spacestation in low Earth orbit to act as a construction berth for trans-Martian spacecraft, supplied by single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles.

\item Send a spacecraft constructed within the spacestation that carries the minimum necessary to bootstrap a settlement, like \chemical{H_2}. Use a nuclear electric ion-drive propulsion system to get there with indigenous resources to supply the return propellant. 

\item Crew would deploy construction equipment and machinery to process indigenous materials for further expansion and self sustenance, aided with a nuclear reactor. This constitute a permanent outpost, the {\it Arcadian Settlement}.

\item Spacecraft returns to Earth unmanned, but fully fuelled having used {\it in situ} methane/oxygen propellant. Concurrently, the settlement continues to expand available habitats, greenhouses, and other infrastructure.
\stopitemize

{\bf Phase II:}

\startitemize[n]
\item Personnel ferries departing Earth at regular intervals would augment the settlement in population and available expansion potential through the additionally provided manpower.
\stopitemize

A preliminary draft of the {\it Mars Treaty} is produced using a revised {\it Outer Space Treaty} of 1967 A.D. as a basis for a subset of it. The treaty provides the contractual basis for all signatories, outlining the roadmap, responsibilities, and party resource allocations necessary to serve as a vehicle for the terraformation and first manned mission to Mars operating under a United Nations mandate. The treaty also provides an agreement governing the activities of states on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

The terraformation strategy is to be initiated by intercepting {\it 52048 Varuna} and deflecting it to directly impact Mars using a nuclear warhead. Being a C-type asteroid, it contains high levels of hydrated (water-containing) minerals which, when released into the atmosphere as aerosols, will greatly increase the total available cloud condensation nuclei. 

Data was presented at the summit predicting that the direct effect of the introduction of these new dark, carbonaceous, aerosols would be a decrease in albedo since they absorb more solar radiation. This would cause a cascading series of reactions, increasing the mean surface temperature and atmospheric pressure.

The deflection strategy will have the asteroid impact directly over the Martian south pole. The south pole contains a large sheet of buried CO₂ ice approximately 8m thick which, when sublimated, will act as a powerful greenhouse gas, thickening the atmosphere, along with the underlying water ice beneath it.

While the legalities of the project are defined in the {\it Mars Treaty}, the international collaborative project it implicates is known as the {\it Avaneya Initiative}.
\StopTimelineDate

\StartTimelineDate{B.R.}
{\it United Nations General Assembly Resolution 5571} is adopted making the Mars Treaty ratified. The resolution augments {\it Chapter III} of the {\it United Nations Charter} to beget its seventh principle organ, the {\it Space Agency} (UNSA). It is bestowed with a mandate enacting the treaty, and by implication, the Avaneya Initiative.

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs\index{United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs} (UNOOSA\index{UNOOSA}) is dissolved. Its former responsibilities are transferred to UNSA under its new mandate.

The resolution also requires members to accede the North American Union Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA), Asian Aerospace Exploration Agency (AAXA), and all other national member space agencies under centralized UNSA administration. This is granted under the justification that space exploration and settlement ought to be an endeavour for all mankind, best realized through the aggregation of resources.

Lieberman is nominated to the Office of the President of the UNSA, resigning his position as director for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

UNSA's Office of the Avaneya Initiative announces successful bids. The {\it Iterum Shipyard} contract is jointly awarded to Lockheed Martin-Boeing and Mercedes-Pratt & Whitney to robotically build a station remotely in low Earth orbit at a cost of 2.2 billion bancors. The station is to be used as a general purpose interplanetary space vehicle construction platform.

% Lockheed Martin's failed X-33 design would be a good starting point for a model...
% TODO: Get the Sanskrit devangari characters to display some how...
Lockheed Martin-Boeing is awarded a contract to provide three, leased, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO), manned, re-usable, {\it VentureStar VII} class suborbital spaceplanes named {\it Aravans}\footnote{Sanskrit अरवन् for a steed or horse.}. These vehicles provide UNSA with heavy lift workhorses for ferrying personnel and materials to the {\it Iterum Shipyard}. They require no external solid booster rockets or external fuel tank and each operate at less than \frac{1}{5}\high{th} the cost of the retired Space Shuttles.

Lockheed Martin-Boeing is also awarded 21 billion bancors worth of contracts to incrementally provide four direct-launch ferries capable of carrying payload of 150 personnel each, plus provisions. The {\it Tarikins}\footnote{Sanskrit तरीकिन for a ferry-man.} will shuttle settlers to Mars using a nuclear electric ion-drive propulsion system for the outbound trajectory, then provided in orbit with return methane/oxygen (\chemical{CH_4}/\chemical{O_2}) propellant manufactured in {\it in situ}. The {\it Tarkins} will depart Earth every 780 day minimum-energy launch window, taking 180 days to arrive at Mars in constant rotation with each other.

Mitsubishi-Saab's is awarded a contract to robotically construct the {\it Avaneya} remotely within the {\it Iterum Shipyard} orbital berth at a cost of 7.8 billion bancors. The {\it Avaneya} will carry the bootstrap crew and large amounts of construction equipment.

Volvo-John Deere is awarded a contract to provide nuclear electric ion-drive propulsion systems for the {\it Avaneya}, {\it Aravans}, and {\it Tarikins} at a cost of 920 million bancors. It is used for the outbound trans-Martian trajectory, with the return methane/oxygen (\chemical{CH_4}/\chemical{O_2}) propellant manufactured {\it in situ}.

Carlyle Holding's Soros-Murdoch Aerospace is awarded a contract to provide four {\it Mars Positioning System} satellites and the {\it Mars Enhanced Telecommunications Orbiter} carrying an optical relay at a cost 750 million bancors.

Arcadia's greatest achievement has occurred today in its realization that it can do better, that Earth has nothing that it needs, that it will not follow in its examples, and that the era of the Red Horn of Plenty breadbasket is over. Our pursuit now is that of complete autarky."}

Arda concludes his speech acknowledging his passage that morning of the {\it Rubicon Act}, initiating steps to secure the settlement's independence and begetting the first non-terrestrial, autonomous, city-state. Notable portions of the Act include:
\crlf

\startTimelineDocument
\startitemize[5]
\setupwhitespace[big]
\item {\it Article I} declares the colony an independent, sovereign, self-governed, constitutional republic, with the right to self determination. It is self-styled the {\it Republic of Arcadia Planitia (RAP)}, colloquially known by its capital and sole city {\it Arcadia}.

\item {\it Article II} defines the head of state, the {\it Direct Council}. As a direct democracy, governance circumvents elected representatives by having the populace participate interactively in all state affairs digitally. This office functions as both the legislative and executive branches of government. An {\it Executor} is elected through the {\it Direct Council}, along with their cabinet. The Executor and their cabinet are responsible for implementing the edicts of the {\it Direct Council}. The {\it Direct Council} cannot be circumvented under any circumstance, including that of a declared emergency.

\item {\it Article III} defines the state's rule as predicated upon natural law, as opposed to positive law, limiting the state's mandate exclusively to the preservation of life, liberty, property, and rights.

\item {\it Article VII} superannuates the bancor fiat currency with the {\it jenya},\footnote{See the \about[Jenya] for more information.} the first currency to be backed by a rhodium standard. The jenya becomes the exclusive legal tender within the Republic. This requires all Terran interests to acquire Arcadian goods in jenyas only.

\item {\it Article VIII} defines the state's disposition with respect to the military. The creation of a permanent or temporary standing army is forbidden. The creation of militias is permitted with exclusive executive authority resting in the {\it Direct Council}. The militia's three restrictions are that it is forbidden from deployment outside of Arcadia's territorial lands, that its purpose is exclusively defensive, and that it cannot be deployed domestically as an aid to civil power.

\item {\it Article IX} denies the deployment of munitions of war suborbital, orbital, in outer space, or elsewhere.

\item {\it Article X} discharges all public debt held by the {\it International Monetary Fund} and the {\it World Bank} effective immediately. The central banks had been using the registered biological property of the settlers, the birth certificates, as collateral against the debt.

\item {\it Article XI} prohibits the state from providing itself with a not-withstanding clause, preventing circumvention of the act.
