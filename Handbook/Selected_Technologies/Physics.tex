OgreBullet is an OGRE 3D plugin that provides powerful physics capabilities. It is an interface to the underlying free {\it Bullet} physics engine which features 3D collision detection, soft body dynamics, and rigid body dynamics. It is used in many free and non--free games. It has even be used to aid in visual effects in some motion pictures. 

The underlying physics engine can take advantage of available hardware acceleration whenever \index{CUDA}CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) functionality is present. This allows the offloading of resource demanding physics calculations to specialized hardware and freeing the main CPU for other tasks. All modern off the shelf nVidia graphics cards currently support this.
