Footage of alleged riots erupting across Arcadia with security forces responding disproportionately are aired across Earth. Mainstream media attribute the alleged riots to grievances held by dissenters at variance with Free Arcadia partisans now holding public office in Arcadia Hall and the apparent silencing of these dissenters through the use of force. Several critics note the equivalence of Terran gravity in some of the footage but are rapidly dismissed by mainstream media as \quote{cranks} and \quote{conspiracy theorists}.

The United Nations Security Council passes resolution 12664 where it is adopted unanimously. The contents of the resolution are not as of yet made public. It begins with:

\startTimelineGeneralDocument
The Security Council,

Reaffirming the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations,

Determined to combat by all means threats to transplanetary peace and security caused by terrorist acts,

Deploring the gross and systematic violation of human rights, including the repression of peaceful demonstrators, expressing deep concern at the deaths of civilians, and rejecting unequivocally the incitement to hostility and violence against the civilian population and infrastructure excited through {\it in situ} administrative elements of the United Nations Arcadian Settlement,

Recognizing the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in accordance with the Charter,

\startitemize[n]
\setupwhitespace[big]
\item Unequivocally condemns in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks which took place recently at the site of the No. \type{#}2 Railgun on Mars in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement and regards such acts, like any act of international terrorism on Earth, as a threat to transplanetary peace and security;

\item Expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims, their families, and of the United Nations Arcadian Settlement;

\item Calls on all Mars Treaty signatories to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these acts will be held accountable;

\item Calls also on all Mars Treaty signatories to redouble their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts including by increased cooperation and full implementation of the relevant anti-terrorist conventions and Security Council resolutions;

\item Expresses its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks of the Arcadian Settlement railgun bombing, and to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations;

\item Authorizes Mars Treaty signatories that have notified the Secretary-General, acting nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements, and acting in cooperation with the Secretary-General and the Office of the President of the Space Agency, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians, civilian populated areas, and assets under threat of attack in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement, and requests those signatories concerned to inform the Secretary-General immediately of the measures they take pursuant to the authorization conferred by this paragraph which shall be immediately reported to the Security Council;

\item Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.\footnote{Most Security Council resolutions end with this phrase. Article 12 of the United Nations charter states that \quote{While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.} In other words, the General Assembly of many is being instructed by the Security Council of few to not interfere in an affair the latter still wishes to handle exclusively.}

The resolution recommends and authorizes the {\it United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations} (UNDPKO) to place all four of its permanently standing {\it Rapid Reaction Force} battalions on high alert.

\StartTimelineDate{A.R.}
The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations' {\it Joint Chiefs of Staff} assemble in Brussels, European Union. There they liaise with government officials and other high level military UN servants for the first day of a three month summit. The summit is conducted under maximum security. Though its existence is made public, the exercise of a high level of discretion in all of its activities ensures that its nature is not. This draws public criticism due to the presence of a number of high level state officials and the lack of transparency.

Rumours spread rapidly over the solnet purporting the purpose of the summit as one of planning the first off world military occupation of another planet in history. Leaked documents suggest the summits agenda is to address the preparation of all strategic, tactical, logistical, personnel, and financial planning necessary to conduct such an operation. Known high level UNSA liaisons, including UNSA's President Dr. Samuel Lieberman, are captured on camera being hustled in and out of meetings within the compound. Public speculation is further compounded when representatives of major international financial institutions are also captured and exposed over the solnet.

\StartTimelineDate{A.R.}
UNDPKO's summit in Brussels concludes with the establishment of the newly formed {\it Mars Command (MARSCOM)}. It is established under the civilian administered UNDPKO and is now responsible for overseeing all of the latter's peacekeeping operations at the strategic and tactical level, in the route to, in the vicinity of, and on the Red Planet. The headquarters is located at Peterson Air Force Base, North American Union, and is jointly staffed by an international consortium of military personnel from all nations signatory to the Mars Treaty.

Lockheed Martin-Boeing's Skunk Works advanced research facilities begin refitting UNSA's {\it Tarikin III} personnel ferry into the {\it Kali}, a militarized, remotely piloted, spacecraft carrying a payload of personnel and materials. This is in response to a UNSA issued contract for a classified mission payload specification requested by MARSCOM.

Arda receives an asymmetrically encrypted message warning of an allegedly imminent plan drafted by a consortium of Terran financial interests intending to use the United Nations as its delivery platform. The plan apparently would call for the organization and landing of a single battalion of peacekeepers to Martian theatre, operating under MARSCOM command, operating under UNSA, which, in turn, operates as an organ of the UN, which, in turn, allegedly answers to a number of Terran central bank cartels.

The single Rapid Reaction Force battalion provided by the UNDPKO under MARSCOM command would be tasked with...

\startitemize[5]
%\setupwhitespace[big]
\item ...the capture and reclamation of Arcadia and all of its assets to UNSA administration secured by MARSCOM's initial command and control;

\item ...the suppression of all local resistance encountered;

\item ...the declaration and installation of martial law of sufficient time to achieve all strategic objectives;

\item ...the rigging of a settlement election with the succession of Arcadia Hall's incumbent Office of the President with a newly appointed President sympathetic to key Terran industrial and financial interests; 

\item ...the conduction of extrajudicial detention, enhanced interrogation, trial, and execution of all key {\it Free Arcadia} partisans, with the notable exception of...

\item ...the neutralization or capture of ATATÃœRK (Arda's MARSCOM designation) for immediate extraction and custody in Kali in areostationary orbit, prior to extrajudicial rendition back to Earth;

\item ...the reversion of Arcadian currency back to the Terran bancor with the capture of all rhodium backed jenyas held in reserve;

\item ...the resumption of all settlement labour of key personnel necessary for the security of stable deuterium exports.
\stopitemize

The anonymous tip-off contains detailed information on troop movement to Terran MARSCOM administered training facilities, size of units, weapons and tactics to be employed, probable locations of encampment, and route of approach. UNSA allegedly intends to transport the battalion under the handle of the {\it United Nations Emergency Assistance Peacekeeping Force (UNEAPF)}. Its numbers are drawn principally from North American Union and European Union airborne light infantry units with armoured reconnaissance and self-propelled artillery support.

The message is encrypted using a public key of Arda's not used for many years since his long departed days of a military posting with the Mountain and Commando Brigade in Hakkari, European Union. Arda and his staff deem the message credible.

Arda directs the systems team to take out UNSA orbital surveillance capabilities by destroying the {\it Mars Enhanced Telecommunications Orbiter} while they still have access. UNSA transmits a command sequence to the orbiter to revoke Arcadia's keypair but is eight minutes too late. The orbiter burns up its entire attitude control hydrazine fuel reserves, causing it to be incinerated during atmospheric entry after deorbiting itself.

UNSA has the NAUSA JPL lock down all four {\it Mars Positioning Satellites} in anticipation of RAP denial-of-service attacks.

All solnet communications between Earth and Mars that had been brokered by METO are now effectively disabled. The orbiter had also been used for reliable communication between Arcadians. The communications team adapt in its absence with a combination of line-of-sight UHF and shortwave communication, requiring no satellite.

The Security Council makes resolution 12664 and the fact of its unanimous adoption public, but stalls until today. The timing coincides with the saturation of key Terran broadcast networks airing a recent adultery scandal of a prominent Terran celebrity.

{\it Kali's} launch window is missed due to the low-Earth orbit having become overly saturated with space debris. UNSA engineers fear they may be approaching the Kessler effect of causing a runaway chain reaction which would reduce all objects in orbit. Since this would threaten not only the {\it Iterum Shipyard}, but all Terran space exploration, its trans-Martian injection must be rescheduled for the next available launch window of 25 months.
