\StartChapter{Selected Technologies}

It is generally a bad engineering practise to try to re--invent the wheel when there are appropriate resources already available to help solve a problem. We will list by category in this chapter all of the technologies we selected. We will explain each, either in the words of their maintainers, or sometimes in our own.

We always try to stick to using software {\it libre} whenever possible. The only time we might use a non--free tool is in using it as a model in designing a suitable {\it libre} replacement. Another situation would be as a last resort when it was not practical to write a replacement.

Note that not all of these technologies are components within the AresEngine. Some of them might be used in preparing \quote{offline} game assets {\it for} the engine, but not used {\it in} the engine itself.
