\StartSection{Units & Controllers}

A unit is any vehicle, building, or other object distinct from the physical geography with its own unique properties and behaviours. They all have a controller. This could be a human, either the user or some other during a multiplayer session, or the computer's artificial intelligence.

There is the intention for an extensive unit tree. Although the user may direct the locations and activities of units under their control, not all units in the unit tree the user will have access to -- nor will they necessarily even know about or want them. Some units, such as certain types of vehicles and buildings, only agents within the world can create. We refer to these as non-playable units\index{Non-playable units} (NPUs)\index{NPUs}. At other times, they will will be able to create certain units that they may not be able to in other scenarios.

As an example, you can and should build a greenhouse. But other influences in the game world might erect a Clown Food\index{Clown Food} restaurant without having asked if the circumstance was right. Nevertheless, NPUs can usually be influenced by the decisions that you make, even if you are not directly controlling them. Nearly everything influences everything in the game.

But most units can and will change with time depending on various factors that take place in the game world. For example, an area zoned for residential usage may start with only a few pressurized yurts, but after time, it may develop into an extravagant, full fledged, pressurized biodome.

Take a look at \in{figure}[figure:Basic Unit Tree]. This is the basic unit tree that the user will usually be permitted to create. This is a very modest subset of all units possible and does not illustrate the variations in the units can each undergo.
