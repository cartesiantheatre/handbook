\StartChapter{Characters}

Avaneya's characters come from a variety of places on Earth, as is to be expected of any space program with an international flavour. All of those deployed to Mars as part of the Avaneya Initiative have strong scientific backgrounds in their respective fields. This is coupled with proven practical experience to supplement their theoretical knowledge.

All of the characters' idiosyncrasies can and should be revealed indirectly whenever possible in Avaneya. This could be through body language, object symbolism, or perhaps the circumstance of the events they participate in. Or, whenever appropriate, through more direct means, such as through a character's participation in a dialogue or through their own writings. 

The introductory cinematic sequence is ideal for presenting the audience with the characters of Avaneya, though it may only have time to cover the more important ones. The leading character and protagonist, Arda Baştürk, should be the forefront and ought to be the game's most recognizable character.
