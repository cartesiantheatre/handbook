\StartChapter{Leitmotifs}

This is probably the most important chapter in the entire book in helping readers to determine whether this is the project for them to be involved in or not. The game has several recurring ideas, or {\it leitmotifs}\index{leitmotifs}, within it. While they may seem unrelated, they are useful cues in reconstructing a virtual world that is intended as a metaphor of sorts for our most defining contemporary problems.

We would like to keep this \quote{leitmotif set} as minimal as possible. Anything else that we might wish to express, it is hopefully already possible to derive where obvious from those already present. However, if you feel they should be modified in some way, please bring it up on any of the communication media described in \in{section}[Communication]. We are open minded but, like us, you too must be reasonably prepared to substantiate your thoughts.

The following form the core leitmotif set, given in no particular order. 

\startitemize[4]
\head {\em Staged terrorism is in vogue.}

Most major acts of terrorism are staged. This is a fad that has been gaining in popularity. Despite their synthetic nature, this concept remains either unknown or an unregistered interest treated as anecdotal at best by the mainstream media. There is an overwhelming body of evidence implicating government involvement in staging major acts of terrorism for whatever reason.\footnotecite[extras={ p.~193.}][shirer1960]\footnote{{\it Ibid.} pp.~518--520.}\footnotecite[harrit2009]\footnotecite[debunking_911_debunking]\footnotecite[letter_to_minister_regarding_911]\footnotecite[macqueen_911_peace_movement]\footnotecite[turbeville2010_staged_terror]\footnotecite[griffin_andrew2010_murrah_bombing_survivor]\footnotecite[berger2009_mcveigh]\footnotecite[watson2006_mcveigh]\footnotecite[northwoods]\footnotecite[king2010]\footnotecite[chossudovsky2005]

\head {\em Drug policies do not reflect reality.}

The availability and distribution of most of the more dangerous illicit narcotics originate through the covert assistance of governments and major financial institutions.\footnotecite[banks_drug_cartels]\footnotecite[webb1996]\footnotecite[last_white_hope]\footnotecite[cia_drug_plane_crash]\footnotecite[top_mexican_drug_lord]\footnotecite[afghan_opium_kingpin]\footnotecite[cia_drugs_list]\footnotecite[vicente_rule]\footnotecite[ruppert_confronts_deutch] Government drug policies are frequently criticized as being ineffective for undermining the safety of those they were suppose to protect, the public. This is typically done under the common misunderstanding that, however ineffective the policies, they were drafted by those with good intentions, however misinformed they have may been. But this assumption that public safety was a government consideration cannot be a reasonable position to maintain if there is any evidence that any amount of any type of illicit narcotic is produced or distributed by government narcotrafficking operations sponsored at its highest levels.

Interestingly, alcohol, a socially validated, usually legal, recreational narcotic, is more dangerous overall than all of the most common illicit narcotics.\footnotecite[extras={ See figure 2.}][nutt2010]

\head {\em No one is free.}

To be free is to be independent of influence, which no one is. We are all subject to influence; otherwise, there would be no such thing as commercial advertising and information would never have become a corporate commodity.\footnotecite[santoso2008] Everything is connected and nothing happens in a vacuum. \footnote{See {\it The Equality Trust} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\head {\em Neoclassical economics is junk science.}

The major axioms of neoclassical economics, the backbone of modern economic theory, are wrong. People do not always have rational preference, seek self maximization, always act on full and relevant information, or stand the most to gain via competition over cooperation. Markets are not natural systems akin to the laws of thermodynamics, do not always correct themselves, and their growth is sometimes destructive. Commercial advertising assists consumers in becoming uninformed and making irrational choices -- precisely the opposite of what markets are expected to do. The assumptions are many in number and they go on, and on, and on.\footnotecite[lasn2012occupy]\footnotecite[h2oil]\footnotecite[adbusters_jamming_neoclassical_economics]\footnotecite[raj2010]\footnotecite[cobb1999]\footnotecite[adbusters_issue_85]\footnotecite[extras={ See sections 4.6 and 4.11.}][agenda_21] The field is not a science, but a pseudo--science rife with fraud.

\head {\em The most violent repeat offenders work in government.}

Government is among the leading causes of death.\footnotecite[statistics_of_democide] It is generally there to protect the interests of a few unelected principle benefactors and not to make changes in the public interest.\footnotecite[report_from_iron_mountain] Governments tolerate democracy only so long as it remains merely cosmetic and is not permitted to actually function.\footnotecite[extras={ Select the {\it Votes} column to sort demand by vote.}][occupy_poll] This should not discourage people into believing that everyone in government should be treated with suspicion. On the contrary, many work hard to improve the quality of life for everyone. The problem is simply that these people are, for any number of reasons, generally not the ones occupying the relevant positions of authority.

\head {\em Disease begins on the plate.}

Most health related deaths are rooted in diet.\footnotecite[the_china_study]\footnotecite[extras={ According to Campbell, all of the top three causes of death in Canada in 2007 identified by StatsCan are entirely dietary.}][statscan_leading_causes_of_death] This is the reason for the disease state that we live in since nutrition and exercise are not particularly lucrative enterprises.

\head {\em Conventional medicine is fraud.}

Conventional medicine is allopathic medicine. Allopathic medicine is pharmaceutical medicine. Pharmaceutical medicine culminated in 106,000 fatalities in 1994 due to adverse drug reactions (ADR), just in the United States, not counting overdoses, and under the direction of a credentialed allopath. This places the paradigm between the nation's fourth and sixth leading causes of death in that year.\footnotecite[lazarou1998_adr] By estimation then, approximately 2,700,000 fatalities can be attributed to the use of allopathic medications between the years of 1983--2010.\footnotecite[prousky2012_toxicology] 

But fatalities aside, even just the management of disease is at least as damning.\footnotecite[lindsey2012_vitamins_and_diabetes]\footnotecite[leape2000]

By contrast, in considering the dangers of some alternative treatments, but 12 fatalities were allegedly attributable to vitamin supplements during that same time span.\footnotecite[aapcc_annual_reports] Note that these are allegations only and remain unproven.

\head {\em Agribusiness is destroying the planet.}

Agriculture is our principle means of interacting with the planet. Changing what we eat solves many global problems.\footnotecite[food_inc]\footnotecite[food_matters]

\head {\em Today's conquests are made through debt, not the sword.}

Usury, including fractional reserve banking, is slavery.\footnotecite[the_creature_from_jekyll_island]\footnotecite[minutes_bank_of_canada] Debt is the tool of choice in an era of globalization.\footnotecite[perkins2005] This theme will be explored in \in{section}[Combat Globalization].

\head {\em Corporations are not people.}

The notion that corporations deserve the same rights as living human beings has proved itself catastrophic.\footnotecite[the_corporation]\footnotecite[coca_cola_case] This will be elaborated further in sections \in{}[Corporate Personhood] and \in{}[Money As Free Speech].

\head {\em Genes are a cop out.}

Very little of what we call human nature is actually genetic. Genes specify human needs, not behaviour. There is no such thing as {\it default} human behaviour. This will be elaborated upon in \in{section}[Socio--economic Simulation].
\stopitemize

If you have gotten this far and you are still comfortable being involved in this project, you will probably find it rewarding. Otherwise it may not be the best place for you, as it is neither a casual game, nor free of the well justified accusation of having courted controversy. There are no requirements that anyone believe or do anything here. Everyone comes by having made a personal choice and through their own research. But rest assured, there are many other {\it libre} projects that could use the talents of those readers already infuriated or still with serious reservations.

But regardless of whatever readers choose to do, creativity is required in the game's pedagogy. We always try to encourage its users to do some thinking of their own. To paraphrase Socrates, {\it we cannot teach anyone anything. We can only make them think}.
