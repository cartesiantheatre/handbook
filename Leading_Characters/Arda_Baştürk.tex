\index{Baştürk family}Arda was born 6 Capricorn, 33 B.R. in Istanbul, Turkey, to \index{Dursun}Dursun and Ayla Baştürk. His mother, \index{Ayla}Ayla, was an assistant to the manager of a local and independently operating bank. His father was an aeronautical engineer; both were non-practising secular Muslims. The latter initially began his career as a military intelligence officer before completing his engineering studies and securing employment with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Shortly after Arda was born, what was then Turkey, became a member of the European Union. This was a volatile era marked with enormous social, political, and economic change. The times were further accentuated as the European Union underwent a transformation from merely an association of states, to a confederation of states, and finally to a nation state in and of itself in 32 B.R.. The former Turkey and all other members were amalgamated under this transformation, dissolving the traditional geopolitical boundaries that had existed between them for centuries. With political leaders around the world citing the transformation as a success story, within several years the North American Union and others had followed in its example.

Arda's father had been deeply engaged and highly influential as a political writer and activist in opposing Turkey's membership in the European Union, both before and after having obtained it. Several attempts had been made on his life, culminating in a car bomb that had left him paralysed and confined to a wheel chair. He died several months later while still under hospital care. An autopsy identified the cause of death as polonium--210 induced radiation poisoning of unknown origin. 

Ayla was reluctant to discuss politics or the circumstance surrounding Dursun's death with her son. Nevertheless Arda was a precocious child and assembled enough with his uncle's influence to sense his mother knew more. Over time he came to realize that she had suspected the attempts on his father's life had not been the work of independently functioning marginalized extremists, but possibly contrived at a higher level.

By his late teens he was made aware of rumours connecting his father's death with those having relations to a powerful banking cartel of international financiers. However, Arda found international finance uninteresting, convoluted, and of little relation to his principle passion and devotion -- the world of science and natural phenomena. By the time he came of age he had conceded to his mother's advice in leaving the past behind and directed his interests into the more immediate and pressing realities of his own future.

As part of a working class family with only his mother and the occasional support of an uncle to make life possible, Arda had few opportunities that would not come without great labour on his part. It was a time where scarcity and hardship had become a way of life. They were of modest means and his mother knew two things were vital if his son were to achieve any level of security in the world -- a higher education and Dursun's earnest work ethic. With food shortages rampant, unemployment at record highs, protests, and riots in Istanbul's public spaces on a weekly basis; she was convinced that these were essential if her son was to have any way out at all.

Arda went on to study at Istanbul Technical University which would would have allowed him a draft deferment. Although it was made possible through a combination of scholarships, they were not sufficient without his modest salary as an army officer cadet in the reserves.

Arda went on to graduate with a degree in theoretical physics. He was then commissioned as a lieutenant in the army. He completed his research doctorate in heliophysics two years later and his habilitation one year after that. He gained notoriety in having solved a central problem plaguing an early draft of his thesis haphazardly while deployed on a field exercise with his unit.

Although wanting to focus on his research, even with his qualifications, employment was scarce and the army reserves was one of the few opportunities available that was stable and left him with enough financial security to afford occasional time to private study. He was well respected in the army as a natural born leader; though his private conviction was one of resentment towards the internal politics of the institution.

Arda later underwent commando training with the 3\high{rd} Commando Brigade, Siirt, before accepting a posting with the Mountain and Commando Brigade garrisoned in Hakkari, European Union. Rarely able to afford independent travel, this was the next best option. During his stay with the unit he was deployed several times to various locations within the Himalayas to undergo advanced, high altitude, mountain warfare with 12 Gorkha Rifles; a regiment of the former Republic of India that was amalgamated during the Asian Union's unification in 15 B.R.. Upon his return he rapidly rose through the ranks before acting as the unit's liaison officer to oversee North American Union troops undergoing training in Hakkari.

Arda had always been described throughout his life by his peers and colleagues as highly perceptive and intelligent, though generally reserved. His thoughtfulness and demeanour earned him the unofficial nickname by his peers of \quote{Zeno}.

Prior to his time on Mars, directing his above average intellectual gifts with passion to anything other than his principle love of science was a rarity. He avoided political topics. In a world he perceived as economically deteriorating he continued to find comfort in private study whenever time allowed from his military obligations of a senior officer.

At the time of his selection as Mission Commander for the Avaneya Initiative, Arda had left the army several years prior to take up a tenured teaching position at Istanbul Technical University where he lived with his mother.
