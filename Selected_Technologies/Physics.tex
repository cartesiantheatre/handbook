\head {\em OgreBullet}

OgreBullet is an Ogre3D plugin that provides powerful physics capabilities. It is an interface to the underlying {\it libre} {\it Bullet} physics engine which features 3D collision detection, soft body dynamics, and rigid body dynamics. It is used in many {\it libre} and non--free games. It has even been used to aid in visual effects in some motion pictures. 

The underlying physics engine can take advantage of available hardware acceleration whenever \index{OpenCL}OpenCL (Open Computing Language) functionality is present. This allows the offloading of resource demanding physics calculations to specialized hardware like GPUs, DSPs, or FPGAs. Most modern off the shelf graphics cards currently support this.
