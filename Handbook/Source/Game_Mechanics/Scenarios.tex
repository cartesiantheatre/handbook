Scenarios are at the heart of Avaneya. They can be specifically selected through the single player's custom mode, enjoyed with your friends over a LAN, or experienced through the single player's campaign mode (which is itself a series of scenarios). 

These scenarios seek not only to entertain, but also to inform by drawing upon issues in the environmental, social, political, economic, agricultural, and other realms. But each scenario never really draws strictly from any one of the aforementioned. As an example, the issue of water privatization is relevant to a discussion in at least all of the aforementioned. That is why scenarios can incorporate multiple goals. These goals, depending on how the scenarios are scripted, are necessary for the user having successfully completed the scenario.

In all scenarios, the user is responsible for directly controlling, working with, or maintaining in some way people and materials as Arcadians in a function at times similar to that of a mayor, though at other times they may be managing only a handful of units perform a task such as assisting a remote survey team locate ice water as opposed to erecting a city. Regardless, they operate constructively as members of the aforesaid republic.
