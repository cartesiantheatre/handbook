\StartSection{Leonard Kissinger}
Leonard was born 8 Gemini, 37 B.R., New York, in what was then the United States prior to its unification in 30 B.R..

Leonard attended Princeton University where he majored in economics. He graduated {\it summa cum laude} in only three years. Following that, he pursued graduate studies with The Woodrow Wilson School with a focus on public policy analysis and theory of law. After completing his studies, he accepted a teaching position with Harvard.

By 19 B.R., he was a participant in a number of policy groups. These included membership with the Trilaterial Commission, the Aspen Institute, and holding the title of President of the Council of Foreign Relations. He appeared regularly over the years at the World Economic Forum as a guest speaker. He has been involved with the RANND Corporation as an external consultant as well.

In 18 B.R., while maintaining his teaching position at Princeton, Leonard accepted a position as a member of the board of directors at Chase National Bank. He maintained the position up to and following his entry into politics.

Leonard entered the North American Union's Department of State as a diplomat in 15 B.R.. He gained recognition in having been instrumental in applying diplomatic pressure on China to sign the Shanghai Partnership Treaty. When China finally became a signatory, a unified far eastern Asian Union was created. Two years later he became foreign policy adviser to the Secretary of State under the President of the North American Union. His responsibilities included the formalization of relations between the North American Union and the newly created Asian Union. He has also been cited for his involvement in improving bilateral relations between the Asian Pacific and Central American Unions through further cooperation in the roles of their respective central banks.

Leonard has always exercised care in minimizing the publicity of his personal life. However, it is well established that he has always been a strong patron of the arts. Leonard has been a Trustee of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since before his entry into politics. In addition, he is a noted financial contributor to a number of cancer related charity groups, including the Children's Last Wish Fund. Rumours have surfaced in the past that he is said to own significant stock in North American Union-based asset management Carlyle Holdings, along with several pharmaceutical giants.

Leonard is a descendant of the controversial Dr Henry Kissinger. The latter was a noted diplomat and businessman, highly influential in the political circles of his time.
