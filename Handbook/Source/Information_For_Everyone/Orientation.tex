If you are new to the project, welcome! You will probably enjoy working on it and the sense of community {\sl software libre} projects tend to embrace. To get you started, the following is a simple checklist you should probably do when you can.

\item
Join the Avaneya Crew on Launchpad. Membership requires approval. If you already received an invite, this should already be setup. Otherwise, just ask. There is always lots more room in the project for more talent. @xref{Launchpad Avaneya Crew} for details.

\item
Also join the private discussion mailing list at the aforementioned link. Once on, I recommend you email the list and let everyone know a bit about yourself. They are all good people and will be happy to see a new face. You will be joining fellow musicians, engineers, and artists. @xref{Mailing Lists} for details.

\item
If you do not have any time to be involved in the project, do not make things difficult on yourself in wanting to get involved.
