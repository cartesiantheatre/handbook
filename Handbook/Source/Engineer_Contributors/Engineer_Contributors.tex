\StartChapter{Engineer Contributors}

This chapter covers some key things that engineers working on the project should be familiar with. If you are not an engineer, or simply not interested in the things they will have to deal with in this project, your eye lids will probably get heavy reading through it. Do not tax yourself. There is not much a typeface or web designer really needs to take away from this chapter anyways. On the other, if you intend to submit project code, you should not skip this chapter.
