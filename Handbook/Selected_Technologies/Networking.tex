\head {\em ENet}

ENet provides the low level library which Avaneya's multiplayer protocol is built on. Its purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust network communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The primary feature it provides is optional, reliable, in--order delivery of packets. It omits certain higher level networking features such as authentication, lobbying, server discovery, encryption (which we provide via GnuTLS), or other similar tasks that are particularly application specific so that the library remains flexible, portable, and easily embeddable.

\head {\em GNU Transport Layer Security Library}

The GNU Transport Layer Security Library (GnuTLS) is a free software implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols. It is used to provide encryption at the application level to make it more difficult for an uninvited third party to be a nuisance or eavesdrop.
