\StartSection{Controllers}

All units have a controller. This could be a human, either the user or some other during a multiplayer session, or the computer's artificial intelligence.

Avaneya has an extensive unit tree as part of its game mechanics. Although the user may direct the locations and activities of units under their control, not all units in the unit tree the user will have access to -- nor will they necessarily even know about or want them. Some units, such as certain types of vehicles and buildings, only agents within the world can create. We refer to these as non-playable units\index{Non-playable units} (NPUs)\index{NPUs}.

As an example, you can and should build a greenhouse. But other influences in the game world might erect a Clown Food\index{Clown Food} restaurant without having asked if the circumstance was right. Nevertheless, NPUs can usually be influenced by the decisions that you make, even if you are not directly controlling them. Nearly everything influences everything in the game.

But most units can and will change with time depending on various factors that take place in the game world. For example, an area zoned for residential usage may start with only a few pressurized yurts, but after time, it may develop into an extravagant, full fledged, pressurized biodome.
