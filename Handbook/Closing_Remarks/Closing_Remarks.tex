\StartChapter{Closing Remarks}

This was a difficult book to write. It forced us to commit our ideas to paper, causing us to reflect on, examine, redesign, and refine them as they came out. Had it not been for you, this process would probably never have happened as carefully as it did.

The neoclassical economist's unchecked assumption that we can be modelled as passive cattle there to graze has to go. This project reminds all of us that we do not have to limit ourselves to being merely {\it consumers} of culture and information, {\it bit sinks}\index{bit sink}, but that we can also be {\it producers} of it. We need not wait on anyone. This is the spirit of {\it libre} culture.

On behalf of all of us, we would like to extend our gratitude for your having taken the time to study this project comprehensively. Avaneya has an exciting future ahead of it. We hope you will choose to be a part of it.
