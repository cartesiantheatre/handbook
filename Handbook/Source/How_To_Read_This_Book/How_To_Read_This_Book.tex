\StartChapter{How To Read This Book}

Be honest. Large books are intimidating. Fortunately in the case of this one, most people need not read it in its entirety. Having said that, project contributors certainly have nothing to lose in doing so. We tried to organize it in such a way that readers benefit the most when its chapters are explored in the order given in the book.

Depending on who you are, different parts of this book will appeal to you more so than others. We describe who you might be in the context of a member of our open community in \in{section}[Specialities].

If you are a passive, casual, or non-technical reader, simply wanting the Coles Notes on the project, we encourage you to check out chapters \in[Leitmotifs], \in[The Game], \in[Leading Characters], and \in[Timeline] at a minimum. This should get you up to speed in as little time as possible.

If you are, or would like to consider being a contributor, you will probably benefit from reading most of this book. One noteworthy exception is \in{chapter}[Engineer Contributors], unless you would like to get involved in an engineering capacity or simply curious what types of problems the engineers will have to deal with.

With that out of the way, on we go!
