\StartChapter{Selected Technologies}

It is generally a bad engineering practise to re-invent the wheel by creating something in a vacuum when there are already many usable components. Avaneya's dependent technology is examined here, grouped by category. It is sometimes explained in their maintainer's own words.

We always try to stick to using free software whenever possible. The only time we might use a non-free tool is to use it as a model in designing a suitable replacement. Another time would be where writing a replacement would be far too difficult and we have no choice.

Note that not all of these technologies necessarily form components of the AresEngine itself, such as Audacity and GIMP, but may be used in preparing game media for the engine.
