@section Why?
Too often, people have come out of experiencing a great dystopian
science fiction novel or film, only to say to themselves, Thank
god we don't live in @emph{that} world. That needs to change.

@noindent
Dystopian science fiction can arguably be among the most honest kind
of story telling when examined in the context of history. But unless
people can see the connection between the world they perceived in
fiction and the one they inhabit, vague analogies and cryptic 
metaphors tend to have minimal utility as pedagogical tools.

@section Who Is It Not For?
This game will challenge you and as most have already noticed, it is 
not like other games. Having said that, it is not for some people.

Those who believe things originate in cans or have an attention span
lasting only a few seconds will not enjoy this game. There are already
many games that appeal to them, so that need not be our aim here.
