The Avaneya Crew Handbook has several purposes:
@sp 1

@enumerate
@item
to define the Avaneya project as clearly as possible so that everyone involved understands it;
@sp 1

@item
to provide this project definition in a single canonical location, which is useful when hacking in remote locations with unstable internet access;
@sp 1

@item
and lastly, to save those already preoccupied with the project from having to explain the things which are redundant with this handbook.@footnote{It is usually a good idea to ask questions. But as we say in the hacker community, read the documentation first.}
@sp 1
@end enumerate

This book is probably not as useful to normal users as it is to contributors. It may even spoil elements of the game for the former. On the other hand, normal users are just as likely to enrich the game through constructive feedback. Constructive feedback is best buttressed when coming from an understanding of the project.

If you pass on this handbook to others, it is probably better to pass a link to it in its original location since it is a living document and will continue to change.
