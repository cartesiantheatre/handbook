{\it Arcadia Planitia} comes under fire from orbital shelling. This event marks the first shots ever fired in anger on Mars. {\it Arcadia Hall} is successfully targeted and destroyed, though most of Arcadia is deliberately left intact. Outside of the city, all locations of the suspected subterranean RAP installation are hammered over the next month.

Between the shelling, Arda has personnel erect a rudimentary high-gain directional antenna which circumvents the need for a satellite communication relay to transmit to Earth. Using S-band microwave, he explains to the people of Earth what is happening on Mars and describes UNSA's shelling campaign as an attack on peaceful and defenceless civilians levied from a partially robotically operated orbital installation.

Arda provides a document hacked from a UNSA intranet with a detailed white paper, complete with schematics, of the outpost the shelling originates. The classified document, {\it Project Horizon: A UNSA Study for the Establishment of a Phobos Military Outpost}, details an ambitious covert UNSA project to construct {\it Thor Outpost}. According to the document, the outpost would be manned by a garrison of a single platoon of thirty soldiers, powered by three nuclear reactors, and located on the Martian moon Phobos. The mostly porous composition of the moon allows for easy escavation. This means that the majority of the installation remains subterranean. If the document is genuine, then the installation had been kept from being public knowledge, as it is clear it has nothing at all to do with sustainability research on Mars. High resolution imagery taken from the Martian surface of the installation accompany the transmission as evidence.

Responses on Earth among citizenry are predominantly a mixture of fury and disgust at the actions of their governments acting collectively. Amnesty International calls for public investigations with power of subpoena to be held immediately.

...The Phobos outpost is required to develop and protect UNSA interests on Mars; to develop techniques in Phobos and general orbital-based surveillance of Mars, in communications relay, and in operations on the surface of Mars; to serve as a base for exploration of Phobos, for further exploration into space and for military operations on Phobos if required; and to support scientific investigations on Phobos...

Arda explains that by exploiting a legal loophole in the {\it Outer Space Treaty}, the {\it Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty}, and the {\it Mars Treaty} whose drafting predated the advent of kinetic bombardment weapons, UNSA believes it is justified in dropping hypersonic tungsten rods with surgical precision at downward velocities of 10 km/s on the surface. The treaties do not observe kinetic bombardment as weapons of mass destruction since they require no explosive payload, though they deliver sufficient kinetic energy in the order of a small tactical nuclear weapon.

The transmission is picked up on Earth by amateur radio operators and quickly disseminated over the solnet. UNSA dismisses Arda's claims as {\it "baseless allegations propagated by Terran conspiracy theorists, intertwined with a misunderstanding of the nature of meteorite strikes on Mars, and used to justify the theft and reckless destruction of the costly off-world public asset of the Arcadian Settlement"}. A UNSA spokesman refuses to respond to questions on the existence of the controversial outpost.

A subsonic aircraft crashes 40 km south of RAP Starport carrying 3600 kg of cocaine in the plains of {\it Arcadia Planitia}. The transportation secretary's investigators confirm that the aircraft's tailnumber was registered to the CIA for alleged UNSA diplomatic flights. Chemical analysis suggests it to be the first known synthetic cocaine and of Martian origin.
