\StartTimelineDate{42 Leo, 2 A.R.}
A disarmed and dismounted UNMEPF brigade is escorted on both its flanks by dual columns of Arcadian dragoons and infantry. The critically wounded, of either side, are rapidly transferred to an Arcadian hospital manned partially with UN medical personnel under Arcadian custody. The dead temporarily remain behind frozen. The prisoners of war are destined for Arcadia's underground emergency shelter. The brigade's vehicles and ordnance are dispersed to various Arcadian units.

Arcadia Hall is repopulated with staff overseeing the transfer of settlers from the shelter back to their homes mostly within the city. The shelter, whose means of movement in and out are few in number, becomes an easily guarded and practical prisoner of war camp for the quartering of the UNMEPF brigade.

Arda reassures Nilhara that, although he is confident MARSCOM would neither have encouraged nor permitted the latter to abide by the Geneva Conventions, this is an opportunity for Arcadia to present itself to Earth as a civilized state by tending to the sick and wounded of either side without reproach or prejudice.

Nilhara agrees to provide Arcadia Hall with access credentials to the {\it Bhadra I/II} satellites. Arcadia's solnet connectivity with Earth is re--established.

Arda contacts the Secretary--General to establish a back door diplomatic communication's channel. From this sol and the eight that succeed it, the following terms are successfully negotiated over diplomatic cables. The concessions of the United Nations are as follows:

\startitemize[R]
\item The General Assembly shall acknowledge the Republic of Arcadia Planitia as a legitimate and independent state and shall not infringe upon its sovereignty.

\item The Republic of Arcadia Planitia shall be represented in the General Assembly on Earth with a representative of its own choosing. Arda is reassured that he will be given amnesty whether he chooses to fulfil that office himself or not, though he declines.

\item The United Nations shall cease peacekeeping operations in the proximity of, and within, Arcadia. The term \quote{hostilities} is never used. The Secretary--General, on behalf of the Security Council, does not unambiguously reaffirm any commitment to the principles of prohibition of the deployment of munitions of war, suborbital, orbital, or in outer space, and therefore, does not acknowledge {\it Thor Outpost}. Questions of its use, consequently, still remain quietly unresolved.

The concessions of the Republic of Arcadia Planitia are as follows:

\startitemize[R]
\item All UNMEPF prisoners of war are to be treated humanely in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.

\item All UNMEPF prisoners of war are to be returned to Earth as soon as logistically feasible.

\item The Republic of Arcadia Planitia shall become a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, allowing the United Nations to be represented with a permanent diplomatic mission in Arcadia. This shall include a single embassy, but possibly one or more consulates as agreed upon in the future.

\item A limited number of Terran corporations are permitted to resume commercial activity in Arcadia. With their registered offices on Earth, the status of corporate personhood within Arcadia remains unofficially unresolved.

Arcadia Hall prepares formal requests to various Terran nations for the opening of embassies in the North American Union, European Union, Venezuela, Cuba, and others. In turn, it receives a submission of Leonard's credentials for entry into the UN's diplomatic mission in Arcadia. Arcadia Hall rejects Leonard's application as a {\it persona non grata}, as permitted under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention.

Arcadian forces transport UNMEPF personnel, including the dead, to the dropsite for Kali's MADVs. Senka assists them with refuelling and performing preflight checks. Arda returns Nilhara's sidearm accompanied with a bottle of Arcadian Manowar. The pair salute prior to the spacecraft's ignition and ascent.

Kali's crew return to Earth. Nilhara is immediately taken into custody and debriefed. He is tried by a military court--martial on charges of having violated Article 104 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, aiding enemy combatants, when he provided Arda with access credentials to the {\it Bhadra I/II} satellites. He is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole at the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, Fort Leavenworth, North American Union.

Arda holds a public forum at Arcadia Hall on the future of the republic. The forum ends with a public vote carrying a motion to begin an Arcadian diaspora\index{Arcadian diaspora} across Mars. This would begin with the settling of the rest of Arcadia Planitia. The rationale being that a republic of a sole city has little chance of security and independence in a world still too easily dominated by powerful Terran interests.

\StartTimelineDate{9 Capricorn, 2 A.R.}
An inbound subsonic aircraft crashes in the desert of {\it Arcadia Planitia} 40 km south of Starport Arcadia. Emergency responders arrive on scene to find the pilot dead, the first officer missing, and 3600 kg of cocaine dislodged from false bottom coffins with UNMEPF emblems on them. 

Arcadia Hall's transportation secretary informs Arda that his investigators have determined that the tail number of the aircraft was registered to NAU-CIA for UN diplomatic flights. While investigators analyze the substance to determine its origin, it is inadvertently discovered that the material is not only of Martian origin, but of a synthetic form more addictive and dangerous than the genuine substance.
