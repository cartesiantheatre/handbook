The {\it Avaneya Project Crew Handbook} is a guide for new and current contributors to the Avaneya project, a cerebral science fiction game for GNU. 

This document will likely continue to be revised and improved with time. Therefore, because it is a living document, it is probably better to pass on a \href{http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~avaneya/avaneya/trunk/view/head:/Documentation/Contributors/Handbook/Avaneya\%20Project\%20Crew\%20Handbook.pdf}{link} to the latest revision within our Bazaar repository\footnote[]{See \in{section}[Revision Control Management] for details in accessing the Bazaar source repository.} than it is to send a static locally stored copy to another person.

This handbook has several purposes:

\startitemize[R]
\item
To define the Avaneya project as clearly as possible so that everyone involved understands it;

\item
To provide this project definition in a single, consolidated, canonical location;

\item
To politely consider those already engaged in the project from having to explain those things redundant with the handbook.\footnote[rtfm]{It is usually a good idea to ask questions. But as we say in the hacker community, but in a slightly less colourful form, read the documentation first.}
\stopitemize

This book is probably not as useful to normal users as it is to contributors. It may even spoil elements of the game for the former, so consider yourself warned. On the other hand, normal users are just as likely to enrich the game through constructive feedback which is best buttressed with a well informed grasp of the project.
