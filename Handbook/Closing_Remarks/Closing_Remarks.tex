This was a difficult book to write. It forced us to commit our ideas to paper, causing us to reflect on, examine, redesign, and refine them as they came out. Had it not been for you, that process would probably never have happened. 

On behalf of all of us, we would like to extend our gratitude for your having taken the time to study this project comprehensively. Avaneya has an exciting future ahead of it. We hope you will choose to be a part of it. {\it Festina lente.}
