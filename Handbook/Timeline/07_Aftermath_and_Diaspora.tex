\StartTimelineDate{42 Leo, 2 A.R.}
A disarmed and dismounted UNMEPF brigade is escorted on both its flanks by dual columns of Arcadian dragoons and infantry. All critically wounded are triaged and transferred to an Arcadian hospital manned partially with UN medical personnel under Arcadian custody. The dead remain behind frozen. The prisoners of war are destined for Arcadia's underground emergency shelter, exchanging with its previous occupants, the city's evacuees. 

A minimally functional Arcadia Hall with skeleton staff is repopulated and oversees the return of evacuees from the shelter back to their homes. 

The shelter, whose means of movement in and out are few in number, becomes a strategically ideal subterranean location to garrison UNMEPF prisoners of war. The latter's vehicles and weapons are dispersed across various Arcadian units.

Arda reassures Nilhara that, although he is confident UN forces would not have abided by the Geneva Conventions, it is an opportunity for Arcadia to demonstrate to both worlds that it is a legitimate and civilized state by tending to the sick and wounded of either side without reproach or prejudice.

Nilhara agrees to provide Arcadia Hall with access credentials to the {\it Bhadra I/II} satellites. Arcadia's solnet connectivity with Earth is re--established.

Arda contacts the Secretary--General to establish a back door diplomatic communication's channel. From this sol and the eight that succeed it, the following terms are successfully negotiated over diplomatic cables. The concessions of the Security Council are as follows.

\startitemize[R]
\item The General Assembly shall acknowledge the Republic of Arcadia Planitia as a legitimate and independent state and shall not infringe upon its sovereignty.

\item The Republic of Arcadia Planitia shall be represented in the General Assembly on Earth with a representative of its own choosing. Arda is reassured that he will be given amnesty whether he chooses to fulfil that office himself or not, though he declines.

\item The United Nations shall cease peacekeeping operations in the proximity of, and within, Arcadia. The term \quote{hostilities} is never used. The Secretary--General, on behalf of the Security Council, does not unambiguously reaffirm any commitment to the prohibition of the deployment of munitions of war, suborbital, orbital, or in outer space, and therefore, does not acknowledge {\it Thor Outpost}. Questions of its use, consequently, still remain quietly unresolved.
\stopitemize

The concessions of the Republic of Arcadia Planitia are as follows:

\startitemize[R]
\item All UNMEPF prisoners of war are to be treated humanely in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.

\item All UNMEPF prisoners of war are to be returned to Earth as soon as logistically feasible.

\item The Republic of Arcadia Planitia shall become a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, allowing the United Nations to be represented with a permanent diplomatic mission in Arcadia. This shall include a single embassy, but possibly one or more consulates as agreed upon in the future.

\item A limited number of Terran corporations are permitted to resume commercial activity in Arcadia. With their registered offices on Earth, the status of corporate personhood within Arcadia remains unofficially unresolved.

Arcadia Hall prepares formal requests to various Terran nations for the opening of embassies in the North American Union, European Union, Venezuela, Cuba, and others. In turn, it receives a submission of Leonard's credentials for entry into the UN's diplomatic mission in Arcadia. Arcadia Hall rejects Leonard's application as a {\it persona non grata} as permitted under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention.

Arcadian forces transport UNMEPF personnel, including the dead, to the dropsite for Kali's MADVs. Arda offers all UN personnel the opportunity for Arcadian citizenship. Some accept and choose to remain behind. 

Senka assists with the MADV's refuelling and preflight checks. Arda returns Nilhara's sidearm, accompanied with a bottle of \index{Arcadian+Manowar}Arcadian Manowar. The pair salute. The spacecraft's departs.

Henrik is promoted to the Office of the Secretary of State. For his courage in the defence of the city, he is awarded the {\it Order of Arcadia}\index{Order of Arcadia}, the republic's highest civic and military honour -- and the first of it.

Kali's crew return to Earth. Nilhara is immediately taken into custody and debriefed. He is court--martialed on charges of having violated Article 104 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in having aided enemy combatants when he provided Arda with access credentials to the {\it Bhadra} satellites. He is found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole at the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, Forst Leavenworth, North American Union.

Arda holds a public forum at Arcadia Hall on the future of the republic. The forum ends with a public vote carrying a motion to begin an Arcadian diaspora\index{Arcadian+diaspora} across Mars. This would begin with the settling of the rest of Arcadia Planitia. The rationale being that a nation comprising a sole city has little hope of security and independence in a world still easily dominated by powerful Terran interests.

An inbound subsonic aircraft crashes in the desert of {\it Arcadia Planitia} 40 km south of Starport Arcadia. Emergency responders arrive on scene to find the pilot dead, the first officer missing, and 3600 kg of cocaine dislodged from false bottom coffins with UNMEPF emblems on them. 

Arcadia Hall's transportation secretary informs Arda that his investigators have determined that the tail number of the aircraft was registered to NAU-CIA for UN diplomatic flights. While investigators analyze the substance to determine its origin, it is inadvertently discovered that the material is not only of Martian origin, but of a synthetic form more addictive and dangerous.
