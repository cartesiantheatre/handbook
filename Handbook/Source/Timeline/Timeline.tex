\StartChapter{Timeline}
The world Avaneya takes place in is highly self-referential. A fictional timeline is positioned relative to a {\it year zero\index{year zero}}, with years preceding suffixed {\it B.R.\index{B.R.}}, before the republic; while those following are suffixed {\it A.R.\index{A.R.}}, after the republic. This is the convention adopted by \goto{Arda Baştürk}[Arda Baştürk] and his settlers at the time they assert their independence.

Note that a year is defined as a Martian year (MYr) and is not the same as a Terran year. You may want to refer to \in{section}[Time] for a detailed explanation of how Arcadians keep track of time on Mars.

Year zero's placement relative to the Gregorian calendar\index{Gregorian calendar} is deliberately never made explicit. Inferentially, however, one can reason that it is proximate enough for a contemporary audience's relevance, yet distant enough in affording some creative license. This is important because, although Avaneya takes place in the future, it deals largely with contemporary issues.
