\StartSection{Companies}
In Avaneya there are really two kinds of units that contribute to the macro economy, the workforce unit who is like a person, and the company. \
The company acts like a type of workforce unit to simplyfy a multitude of things and to calculate when to be created and satiate demand for certain goods and create demand for other goods. 


\StartSubSection{Creating Companies}
Referring to seciton [...] on demand curves, when workforce units are consuming something in particular be it from a category like food (or one if its subcategories like vegetables) this creates a demand and things will be getting purchased at a certain price. Also as mentioned in section [...] in some cities this price will be predetermined by the player in other cities this price will be determine by the market, or what workforce units are willing to spend on something (refer to section [...micro_economics.tex] for more on workforce units role in the economy).

Companies are created naturally - by the game - when the price of producing each unit of the specific good they will produce is less than what they will sell each unit to the population for.
