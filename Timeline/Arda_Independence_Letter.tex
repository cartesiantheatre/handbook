Dear Mr. Secretary-General,

Earth has been presented to date with the public face of a brave, off-world, United Nations research frontier passionately concerned with all manner of Terran sustainability. The mandate entrusting this first Martian settlement's technical administration to my care under the higher strategic direction and oversight of your Office on Earth has been faithfully executed to date. Dare I say the settlers feel an affection for this world at least that for Earth with neither hesitation nor reservation in having now come to call it home.

From the mission's very onset, as far as most of Earth was concerned, the Arcadian Settlement had only the very best of intentions. But Mars is far from being a perfect world and I believe that we have fallen short of our pledge.

In the beginning, unknown to even the settlers, the settlement had always harboured something inherently sinister — albeit elusive. It was difficult for it to have become obvious any earlier than it had, with nothing other than my own myopic, albeit dedicated attention to what I took to be the immediate and practical operational realities of daily life on Mars as to blame.

But with time a greater picture began to emerge and register — one which, in retrospect, ought to have been obvious from the beginning. By design we had always been covertly setup since inception to emerge one day nothing less than a banana republic. Fashioned as a contemporary Martian analogue ought, at your Office's direction, we brought online starports and railguns for material exports. These have served to endlessly transport and catapult our deuterium and labour across the solar system back to Earth in a manner damningly reminiscent of the gold, silk, and spice of the peoples of centuries past.

All the meanwhile our settlement's sustainability research facilities, of which all Terrans are quite rightfully dependent upon, have been systematically dismantled, one by one, at your Office's direction such that our wealth might be jettisoned ever more expeditiously. These spoils were then appropriated by a morally and environmentally bankrupt world, none other than Earth itself, alleviating none of the suffering of those who shouldered the financial burden that prompted our long and dangerous journey here. Yet we carried on.

We had arrived on Mars under the impression that we had left Earth only to find ourselves still steeped in the very worst of it. This unfaltering bondage to Terran control and money lenders preceded even our terminal descent. If nothing else, that ought to be grievance enough.

I watched and reflected quietly over the years as we laboured without pause to provide for an insatiable appetite for Earth's select few, even as it became apparent that we were being exploited. Such an appetite limited itself amidst all the beauty, splendour, and knowledge the Red Planet's commons had to offer all mankind.

I watched our Martian chronicle unfold as Terran tentacles transformed it from the promised dream of a proud research frontier and beacon of hope it so nearly once was into a romanticized off-world sweatshop — paid for by both Arcadian and Terran alike.

We were never free, Mr. Secretary. We have been living a lie. At this time few of my neighbours are yet to come to terms with this. Goethe\index{Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von} knew it as well centuries ago as we would be naïve not to know it now, for none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who would falsely believe themselves to be free. We came in good faith, laboured tirelessly in taming a dangerous frozen world, and sometimes paid for it with our lives.

I find myself now consumed with a crisis of conscience such that I am no longer able to faithfully execute the directives of your Office as Mission Commander of the United Nations extraterritorial outpost of the Martian Arcadian Settlement. Yet I have not abandoned the responsibilities I was entrusted with. On the contrary, I have never been more available to meet them than now. But I must act immediately if I am to act at all.

Arcadia's greatest achievement occurred today with our realization that we can do better, that Earth has nothing that we need, that we will not follow in its poor examples, and that we ought to now be setting them. We are prepared to realize our plans to assert and, if necessary, defend a long coveted and well deserved independence, having reflected upon the perils of committing ourselves in doing so with the alternative.

It would be naïve to expect your sympathy or those you act in proxy for. But it does not matter now. What matters now is that we genuinely depart Earth's antiquated mentality. This time with no thought of return. This time to realize the dream that carried us here in the first place. {\it Per ardua ad astra.}

Sincerely,
