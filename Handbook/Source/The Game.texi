@section Who It Is Not For
This game will challenge you and as most have already noticed, it is 
not like other games. Having said that, it is not for some people.

Those who believe things originate in cans or have an attention span
lasting only a few seconds will not enjoy this game. There are already
many games that appeal to them, so that need not be our aim here.
