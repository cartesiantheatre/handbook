\StartSection{Single Player}
Let us start with an overview of the different modalities of play. These can be either single or multiplayer. Single player, as the name suggest, the user plays alone. Well, actually, with the computer and the challenges it presents. This includes a tutorial, campaign, and custom mode. The user can also restore from a saved game in all three modes if they wish.



\StartSubSection{Tutorial}
In tutorial mode, the user is guided through interaction with the elements of the game and its user interface by Khalid Zafar, one of the leading characters described in \in{chapter}[Leading Characters]. The aim is to train the user to the point where they are comfortable in taking on the campaign or multiplayer modes.

Due to the extensive nature of Avaneya, a tutorial which covers all of the games aspects would be quite time consuming for the player. A balance needs to be sought between showing the players all the elements of the game and what they need to begin playing the game without continually hitting walls and becoming discouraged.   

Taking into account that the tutorial is separate from the campaign, it should contain little of the essential storyline elements and be designed to give players the knowledge they need to jump into Solnet multiplayer and leave out tutorial elements that may be addressed in the campaign.  

With this in mind, the tutorial should cover elements of zoning lands, erecting and changing buildings, introduce agents and their influence on population and how they may limit player control. It can also bring in a small range of military units to show the diversity of units and how they interact. %This could be done in a series of "chapters" or as a 20 to 30 minute scenario. 

In addition to the tutorial teaching how to play Avaneya, some overlap can occur in the campaign which may become progressively intricate. The idea of this is to get the players comfortable as quickly as possible.



\StartSubSection{Campaign}
In campaign mode, the user assumes the role of Arda Baştürk, or any of the other leading characters, as they journey through the campaign which takes place near and following the end of the fictional timeline described in \in{section}[Aftermath & Diaspora]. That is, around the time of the Arcadian Diaspora. Tutorial elements in the campaign need to be minimal since there is nothing worse then wanting to start a new game and going through all of the learning elements again.

\StartSubSection{Custom}

The custom mode allows users to specifically select which scenarios they would like to play without thought of commitment to a full campaign. This is useful for those who would like to explore nonlinear gameplay. We will discuss scenarios further in \in{section}[Scenarios].
