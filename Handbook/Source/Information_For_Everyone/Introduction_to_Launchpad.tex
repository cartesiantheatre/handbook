\startsection{Introduction to Launchpad}

Launchpad is a project started by Canonical, the company behind the Ubuntu project. It is an online service that allows for coordinated software project collaboration. It provides services for source control management, blueprints, support, bug tracking, and more. The Avaneya project, the people behind it, and the source code as it develops can be found there.
