Dear Mr. Secretary-General,

Earth has been presented to date with the public face of a brave, off-world, United Nations research frontier, passionately concerned with all manner of Terran sustainability. The mandate entrusting this first Martian settlement's technical administration to my care under the higher strategic direction and oversight of your Office back on Earth has been faithfully executed to date. Dare I say, the settlers and I feel an affection for this world at least that for Earth and find ourselves disposed with neither hesitation nor reservation in having now come to call it home.

But Mars is far from being a perfect world. Unbeknownst to even the settlers, the settlement's design since its very inception was a dark one modelled covertly to emerge a banana republic. Fashioned as a contemporary analogue ought, we are outfitted with railguns, endlessly catapulting our deuterium and other material exports across the solar system back to Earth in a manner damningly reminiscent of the gold, silk, and spice of an exploited people of another time.

Concurrently our sustainability research facilities here on Mars, to which Terrans are critically dependent upon, are systematically dismantled such that our wealth may be jettisoned ever more expeditiously. These spoils are then appropriated by a morally and environmentally bankrupt world, none other than Earth itself, alleviating neither the afflictions that prompted our dangerous journey here nor the debts that continue to beset us. Yet we carried on.

I watched quietly over the years as we laboured without pause to provide for this insatiable Terran appetite, even as it was obvious we were being exploited. Such an appetite limits itself but to little more than cornucopianism and usury amidst all the splendour, knowledge, and beauty the Red Planet has to offer humanity. I watched the Martian chronicle unfold as Terran tentacles transformed it from the promised dream of the proud research frontier it once was into the nightmare glorified sweatshop it is now ﹘ at the cost of social justice. 

And now I watch as I have become consumed by a crisis of conscience such that I am no longer able to faithfully execute the directives of your Office as Mission Commander of the United Nations extraterritorial outpost of the Martian Arcadian Settlement.

Yet I have not abandoned my people. On the contrary, I have never been more truly available for them. Arcadia's greatest achievement occurred today with its realization that it can do better, that Earth has nothing that it needs, and that it will not follow in its example. We had arrived on Mars under the impression that we had left Earth, only to find ourselves still steeped in the very worst of it. This unfaltering bondage to Terran money lenders, preceding even our terminal descent that brought us here, if nothing else, is evidence enough.

But it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society, and thus the era of plundering the fruits of the Red Horn of Plenty to the detriment of those who laboured tirelessly and assumed all of the greatest dangers in securing it must end. We were lied to, Mr. Secretary, and we have been living it since the day we landed. Goethe\index{Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von} knew it as well centuries ago as we would be naive not to know it now, for none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe that they are free.

This is undoubtedly difficult for you and all those you have long acted in proxy for to comprehend. But it does not matter now. What matters now is that we are prepared to realize our plans to legislate and assert a long coveted independence, having reflected upon the perils of committing ourselves to doing so with those of not. All that remains is to genuinely depart Earth, this time with no thought of return, and this time to follow through with the dream we began with.

Sincerely,
