@emph{3D Computer Graphics, Second Edition}@footnote{This book is listed as a resource for artists because it is a wonderful and concise introduction to the theory of computer graphics, but for non-programmers and non-mathematicians. It is a classic, though long out of print. Nevertheless, you can probably find used copies for sale.} (book)
