\StartSection{Multiplayer: LAN}

In multiplayer, the user can play cooperatively over the local area network (LAN) with their friends in any of the available scenarios that allow multiplayer LAN use. These LAN sessions are hosted by one of the users for two to any of a handful number of other users. They do not require an internet connection, but do require a local area network. The game world persists for only as long as the multiplayer session is maintained.

As in the case of the single player campaign, the user has the option of loading from a previous saved game. Although only the user actually hosting the game needs to be in possession of the saved game file, in order for this to work all of the original players must still be available.
