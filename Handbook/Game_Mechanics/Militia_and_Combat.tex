% Militia & Combat section...
\StartSection{Militia & Combat}
The option of raising a militia in protecting the user's city forms an aspect of Avaneya's gameplay. Keeping with a sandbox style of play, the use of militia units will be a dynamic process involving varying degrees of player input at the players own discretion. In this section various types of militia units are discussed as well as their creation, movement, and available behaviours. Aspects of these gameplay elements are also discussed in \in{section}[Interface & Interaction]}.

\StartSubSection{Militia Training and Units} 
If the history of strategy games has shown anything, it is that people need enough diversity to keep a game interesting, but having too many choices of units can detract from the experience. From another point of view, the more units and options that are put into a game, the more it needs to be tested since there is greater room for error and abuse. It could be argued that what truly makes massively expansive games a disappointment is that they are untested, making some units an obvious choice while creating dead end paths which inhibit experimentation. Expansive games need to be well tested, and while they can offer experimentation, a fine line between creativity and aimless needs to be tread carefully. The idea of being able to create city management options, defending it, encouraging research and innovation, needs to be constrained initially as they explore their options.

This is most true for the training and use of military units which may change the tide of a games balance, especially on Solnet. Militia units can be trained at the user's prospective military academy, producing personnel as affected by the underlying social conditions and values. This might include effecting how frequently they can be trained and the degree to which this can occur. It may be very hard for cities with a farming or labour workforce to produce officers with highly technical knowledge some areas, whereas they may be better naturally adept at operating large military machinery.

Machinery on the other hand can be produced by a city's population or imported from another city.

% Adam: Will this machinery be useable on its own or require trained militia? 
% Kip: Requires personnel with appropriate training. This is why infantry is so 
%  versatile, because it is cheap to raise and doesn't require the depth of 
%  technical knowledge that crews on naval destroyers or in bombers require.


\StartSubSection{Attacking and Defending}
When a unit deemed an enemy is within line of sight and range of a unit they will engage provided they have the ability. They will also alert other units in there vicinity and through radio where applicable causing other units to engage in group tactics. Units can also be told to attack units by selecting the unit then right clicking the enemy unit, this can also be done by selecting the unit, left clicking the attack function on the user interface then left clicking the enemy unit or unit you want attacked. Depending on the units current stance the manner in which they engage the enemy will vary. As described above, various movement styles cause units to act differently towards the enemy. Also relevant is defensive or combat stances. Units can be put into aggressive, defensive, or general combat stances.

Units with certain weapons or abilities can also be given unique commands. Depending on situations they may utilize these abilities automatically but players can choose to use these at a time and in a manner that they see fit. 

Examples of unique commands may be:
\startitemize[16]
 \item[suppressive fire]
 \item[draw fire]
 \item[ignore enemy fire]
 \item[grenade or various explosives]
 \item[charge]
 \item[hide]
 \item[take cover]
 \item[destroy cover]
 \item[assist]
 \item[mantle]
 \item[dismantle]
 \item[force reload]
 \item[regroup]
 \item[repair]
 \item[medical attention]
 \item[call fire support]
\stopitemize



\StartSubSection{Attacking and Defending Cities}
While units movement in general will be the same, moving through hostile terrain can be a time consuming process. This is multiplied by moving through enemy cities or cities held by another player. City streets hold lots of hiding places and spots for cover, but also hide ambushes, militant civilians, and multiple story buildings. Fast movement through city spaces leaves flanks open and areas unturned. 

On Solnet, due to its MMO gameplay, this is very relevant. While players cities can be attacked when they are offline they will not be able to be completely destroyed/captured due to the nature of street by street warfare. The aim is to make attacking and defending cities a gradual and expensive process (as it is) so that a player can log onto Solnet once per week and still defend his city or continuing the attack on someone else. 

With this in mind infantry movement through city streets will take a gradual, street by street clearance approach unless being ordered otherwise. The aim is to make attacking cities a long, drawn out affair with little strategic room for error by the attacker, or by defender reclaiming lost land/streets/buildings. Some methods in which this can be accomplished may be:
 
Multiple rooms and stories in buildings which require clearing and where fighting can get bogged down.
 Civilians left behind or angry which will fight back or cause ambushes.
 Media and civil unrest at attackers homeland due to civilian casualties.
 The need to import resource for attacking units.
 Ease of defender sending in resource and units due to proximity.
 Large city scape extrapolates issues. 
 Day night cycle effecting combat conditions and strategic styles.
 Line of sight conditions making long city streets vulnerable, requiring slow movement.
 General expseniveness straining alliances and creating vulnerabilities in attackers cities. 




\StartSubSection{Artillery}
%This section will deal with mechanics of explosive warfare and its balance on Solnet.

\StartSubSection{Unit Noise Exposure}
When units move, shoot, and generally perform actions they make noise, the degree of this noise may alert other units to their presence. A method of display noise is a sound wave indicator at the locations vicinity and on the mini--map. Focusing on the location will play the sound for players attention.
