% Leitmotifs chapter...
\StartChapter{Leitmotifs}

This is probably the most important chapter in the entire book in helping readers to decide whether this is a project for them to be involved in or not. Avaneya has several recurring ideas or {\it leitmotifs}\index{leitmotif} within it that will help you to determine how the project resonates with you.

We would like to keep the leitmotif set as minimal as reasonably possible, with everything else that we felt relevant, it hopefully already being possible to derive when obvious from that which is already present. However, if you still feel the set should be modified in some way, please bring it up on any of the project crew communication methods related in \in{section}[Communication]. We are open minded but, like us, you must also be prepared to reasonably substantiate your argument.

The following form the core leitmotif set the project felt were important, given in no particular order.

\startitemize[4]
\head {\em Most acts of terrorism are staged.}

Synthetic terrorism is a fad that has been gaining in popularity over the centuries. Despite this, most do not know that most acts of terrorism are staged by governments.\footnotecite[extras={ p.~193.}][shirer1960]\footnote{{\it Ibid.} pp.~518--520.}\footnotecite[harrit2009]\footnotecite[debunking_911_debunking]\footnotecite[letter_to_minister_regarding_911]\footnotecite[turbeville2010_staged_terror]\footnotecite[griffin_andrew2010_murrah_bombing_survivor]\footnotecite[berger2009_mcveigh]\footnotecite[watson2006_mcveigh]\footnotecite[northwoods]

\head {\em Drug policies do not reflect reality.}

Most illicit narcotics originate from governments.\footnotecite[cia_drug_plane_crash]\footnotecite[top_mexican_drug_lord]\footnotecite[afghan_opium_kingpin]\footnotecite[cia_drugs_list]\footnotecite[vicente_rule]\footnotecite[ruppert_confronts_deutch] Thus, criticizing the public policy measures governments undertake as being out of genuine ignorance, albeit with the best of intentions, cannot be correct. Interestingly, alcohol, a socially validated, recreational narcotic, is usually legal, yet still more dangerous than all of the most common illicit ones anyways.\footnotecite[extras={ See figure 2.}][nutt2010]

\head {\em No one is free.}

To be free is to be independent of influence, which no one is. We are all subject to influence, otherwise there would be no such thing as advertising. Everything is connected and nothing happens in a vacuum. \footnote{See {\it The Equality Trust} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\head {\em Neoclassical economics is junk science.}

The major axioms of neoclassical economics, the backbone of modern economic theory, are wrong. People do not always have rational preference, seek self maximization, always act on full and relevant information, or stand the most to gain via competition over cooperation. Markets are not natural systems akin to the laws of thermodynamics, do not always correct themselves, and their growth is sometimes destructive. The assumptions are many in number and they go on, and on, and on.\footnotecite[lasn2012occupy]\footnote{See {\it Adbuster's} \href{http://anticap.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/jamming-neoclassical-economics/}{Jamming neoclassical economics} campaign, with prejudice for \href{http://www.adbusters.org/cultureshop/backissues/85}{Issue \#85}.}\footnotecite[raj2010]\footnotecite[cobb1999] The field is not science, but a pseudo-science rife with fraud.

\head {\em Governments are violent repeat offenders.}

Government is among the leading causes of death.\footnotecite[statistics_of_democide] It is generally there to protect the interests of a few unelected principle benefactors and not to make changes in the public interest.\footnotecite[report_from_iron_mountain] Governments tolerate democracy only so long as it remains merely cosmetic and does not actually threaten it.\footnotecite[extras={ Select the {\it Votes} column to sort demand by vote.}][occupy_poll]

\head {\em Disease starts on the plate.}

Most health related deaths are rooted in diet.\footnotecite[the_china_study]\footnotecite[extras={ According to the study, the top three causes of death are entirely dietary.}][statscan_leading_causes_of_death]

\head {\em Conventional medicine is fraud.}

Conventional medicine is allopathic medicine. Allopathic medicine is pharmaceutical medicine. Pharmaceutical medicine culminated in 106,000 fatalities in 1994 due to adverse drug reactions (ADR), just in the United States, not counting overdoses, and under the supervision of a credentialed allopath. This places the paradigm between the nation's fourth and sixth leading cause of death in that year.\footnotecite[lazarou1998_adr] By estimation then, approximately 2,700,000 fatalities can be attributed to the use of allopathic medications between the years of 1983--2010.\footnotecite[prousky2012_toxicology] But fatalities aside, even just management of disease is just as damning.\footnotecite[lindsey2012_vitamins_and_diabetes]

By contrast in considering the dangers of alternative treatments, but 12 fatalities were allegedly attributable to vitamin supplements during that same time span.\footnotecite[extras={ Note that these are allegations only and remain unproven.}][aapcc_annual_reports] 

\head {\em Agribusiness is destroying the planet.}

Agriculture is our principle means of interacting with the planet. Changing what we eat solves many global problems.

\head {\em Conquest is made through debt, not the sword.}

Usury, including fractional reserve banking, is slavery.\footnotecite[the_creature_from_jekyll_island]\footnotecite[minutes_bank_of_canada] Debt is the tool of choice in globalization.\footnotecite[perkins2005]

\head {\em Corporations are not people.}

Giving corporations the rights of human beings has been catastrophic.\footnotecite[the_corporation]\footnotecite[coca_cola_case]

\head {\em Genes are a cop out.}

Very little of what we call human nature is actually genetic. Genes specify human needs, not behaviour. We will elaborate on this in \in{section}[Socioeconomic Simulation].
\stopitemize

If you have gotten this far and you are still comfortable being involved in this project, you will probably find it rewarding. Otherwise it may not be the best place for you, as it is neither a casual game, nor free of courting controversy. There are no requirements that anyone believe or do anything here. Everyone comes by having made a personal choice. But rest assured, there are many other {\it libre} projects that could use the talents of those still with serious reservations.

But regardless of whatever readers choose to do, creativity is required whenever we present the aforementioned. We always try to encourage users to do some thinking of their own. To paraphrase Socrates, {\it we cannot teach anyone anything. We can only make them think}.
