\StartSection{Resources For Everyone}
These resources are useful for every kind of contributor, from researchers and writers to modellers and engineers.

You might consider reading some of these resources in order to enrich your understanding of the game, whose fabric is drawn from {\it at least} all of them. The more background knowledge we have, the greater the quality of the game. The same goes for really any kind of complex simulation, and not just Avaneya.
