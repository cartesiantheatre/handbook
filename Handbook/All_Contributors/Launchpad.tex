\StartSection{Launchpad}

Launchpad is a generous project started by Canonical, the organization behind Ubuntu. It is a platform allowing for online project collaboration by providing methods for revision control management, design, support, issue tracking, and more. We host our source code and other essential services there.

If you would like to submit changes to the source code, you will need to add yourself to the Launchpad Avaneya Project Crew.

\StartSubSection{Issue Tracking}
Launchpad's issue tracker, usually referred to as a bug tracker, is actually useful for tracking any kind of issue -- not just bugs. For this reason, we refer to it as an issue tracker.

Anyone with a Launchpad account can report an issue and need not be a member of the project crew.
