The world Avaneya takes place in is highly self-referential. A fictional timeline is positioned relative to a {\it year zero\index{year zero}}, with years preceding suffixed {\it B.R.\index{B.R.}}, before the republic; while those following are suffixed {\it A.R.\index{A.R.}}, after the republic. This is the convention adopted by \goto{Arda}[Arda Baştürk] and his settlers around the time they declare their independence.

Note that a year is defined as a Martian year (MYr) and is not the same as a Terran year. You may want to refer to \in{section}[Time] for a detailed explanation of how Arcadians keep track of time on Mars.

Year zero's placement relative to the Gregorian calendar\index{Gregorian calendar} is deliberately never explicitly given. But inferentially, one can reason it is proximate enough for a contemporary audience to feel relevant, yet distant enough to afford some creative license. This is because, although Avaneya takes place in the future, it deals with many contemporary issues.
