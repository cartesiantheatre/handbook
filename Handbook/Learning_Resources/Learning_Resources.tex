\StartChapter{Learning Resources}

A great way to better prepare yourself for working on this project is to take a look at some relevant learning resources. Feel free to check out as few or as many as you like. 

All of these resources you should be able to find through major bookstores or sometimes freely on the internet. Most of them are not difficult to find.
