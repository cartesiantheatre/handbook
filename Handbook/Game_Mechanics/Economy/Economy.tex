\StartSection{Economy}
A cities economy is a diverse and complex aspect of gameplay in Avaneya yet however complex the implementation of the economy becomes the players use of it should be fluent and intuitive, allowing for varying degrees of complexity and involvement depending on a players style of play. This can be done with a good user interface, solid economic construction, and clever AI. 

This section deals with the variety of ways cities earn and spend money and maps out the paths that spending makes. To begin with we will discuss income streams for a players cities. These are primarily made up of taxation, exports (and imports), and city resources and infrastructure. Within each of these categories are several methods which players can use to generate income.


%Figure showing flow of city expense and income
The above figure shows how income is also generated from some of the cities expenses. Expenses can be seen of as investments varying in lengths and 
amounts of returns. Zoning for instance is a relatively cheap investment at city expense which has further investment from private capital to generate a form of growth which can be taxed or processed through fees to generate city income. This simple investment can be made more complex through adding infrastructure which may increase desirability and allow for higher fees or taxes. Other forms of investment, such as funding, divert money into projects the player/city desires allowing for complex growth along specific avenues. This is all explained in the above figure where paths of expense and income can be traced.




\StartSection{Income Streams}

City income is generated in 6 ways.

1.  Taxation
2.  Fees and ordinance
3.  Imports and Exports
4.  Commodities

The forms of income used is completely up to the players. They can use as many or a little of these as they wish.



\StartSection{Expenditure}

1.  Infrastucture and City Buildings
2.  Funding
3.  Ordinance
4.  Zoning
5.  Militia
6.  Goods and Services
