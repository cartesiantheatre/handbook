\StartChapter{Preface}

Avaneya is a cerebral science fiction game set on Mars. It combines the perfect blend of the metropolis city builder social simulation, real time strategy, and cooperative multiplayer. It explores mature themes in politics, economics, ecology, sociology, and more. Players creatively craft beautiful cities and watch as they form civic and cultural lives of their own driven by sophisticated artificial intelligence. It takes some of the most powerful capabilities of today's technology, builds upon it, and finds an application in a manner which is as original as it is entertaining.

Avaneya is geared towards at least those with a passion for hard science fiction, software {\it libre}, users of the GNU operating system,\footnotecite[gnu_users_who_have_never_heard_of_gnu] and its various popular incarnations.\footnotecite[about_ubuntu] It is unlike any previous work in its entirety, but would certainly appeal to those with an affinity for the artistic style of Blade Runner and some of the game mechanics of SimCity. 

This book was authored as a \quotation{design bible} to harmonize all technical and creative efforts of the professional artists, engineers, musicians, writers, and others required in Avaneya's interdisciplinary production schedule.

This is a living document and will likely continue to be revised over time. It is therefore better to pass on a direct \href{\LatestHandbookURL}{link} to the most up to date revision than to a potentially outdated one.

Our purposes were several in number in authoring this book:

\startitemize[4]
\item
To create a place for contributors to refine their ideas, think them through, and commit them to \quotation{paper}. This aids in deliberation and provides a place for review;

\item
To provide a single, consolidated, canonical work as a reference volume during the production schedule.
\stopitemize

This book is intended for {\it contributors} and is not appropriate for players. Indeed, it may even spoil elements of the game. Consider yourself warned!

On the other hand, players are just as likely to enrich the game through constructive feedback -- feedback best buttressed with a well--informed understanding of the project's goals and the thinking behind it.
