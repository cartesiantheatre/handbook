% Launchpad section...
\StartSection{Launchpad}

Launchpad is a project started by Canonical, the organization behind the Ubuntu project. It is a service that allows for online project collaboration. It does this by providing methods for revision control management, blueprints, support, issue tracking, and more. The Avaneya project's source code, as it developes, can be found there.

If you want to join, make sure you remember to add yourself to the Launchpad Avaneya Project Crew.

% Issue Tracking subsection...
\StartSubSection{Issue Tracking}
Launchpad's issue tracker, usually referred to as a bug tracker, is actually useful for tracking any kind of issue - not just bugs. For this reason, we refer to it as an issue tracker. We use it for triaging resources, keeping track of what still needs to be fixed, and other things. 

Anyone with a free Launchpad account can report an issue and need not be a member of the project crew. This is important since Avaneya could potentially crash for anyone.
