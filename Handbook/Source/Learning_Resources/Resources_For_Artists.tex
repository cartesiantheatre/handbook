\cite[three_d_computer_graphics]\footnote{This book is listed as a resource for artists because it is a wonderful and concise introduction to the theory of computer graphics, but for non-programmers and non-mathematicians. It is a classic, though long out of print. Nevertheless, it is not hard to find used copies available for sale.}
