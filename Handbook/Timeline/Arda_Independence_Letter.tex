Dear Mr. Secretary-General,

Earth has been presented to date with the public face of a brave, off-world, United Nations research frontier, passionately concerned with all manner of Terran sustainability. The mandate entrusting this first Martian settlement's technical administration to my care under the higher strategic direction and oversight of your Office back on Earth has been faithfully executed to date. Dare I say, the settlers and I feel an affection for this world at least that for Earth and find ourselves disposed with neither hesitation nor reservation in having now come to call it home.

From the project's very onset, as far as the average Terran has been concerned, the settlers have always had only the very best of intentions for the needs of Earth. But Mars is far from being a perfect world. 

In the beginning, unknown to even the settlers, the settlement had always something inherently sinister about it. Even to those with the most capable minds among my colleagues, its precise nature remained elusive. It was difficult for it to have revealed itself any earlier than it had, with nothing other than my own myopic, albeit focused, attention immersed in what I took to be the immediate and practical realities of daily life in a Martian operational environment to blame.

But with time, a greater picture began to emerge among my colleagues and I — one which should have been obvious. By design, we had always been covertly setup, since inception, to emerge one day nothing less than a banana republic. Fashioned as a contemporary analogue ought, at your Office's direction, we brought online starports and railguns. These have served to endlessly transport and catapult our deuterium and other material wealth across the solar system back to Earth in a manner damningly reminiscent of the gold, silk, and spice of another exploited people of another time.

All the meanwhile our settlement's sustainability research facilities, of which all Terrans are quite rightly critically dependent upon, have been systematically dismantled, one by one, at your Office's direction such that our wealth could continue to be jettisoned ever more expeditiously. These spoils are then appropriated by a morally and environmentally bankrupt world, none other than Earth itself, alleviating neither the afflictions that prompted our dangerous journey here to begin with, nor the debts that continue to beset us — yet we carried on.

We had arrived on Mars under the impression that we had left Earth, only to find ourselves still steeped in the very worst of it. This unfaltering bondage to Terran money lenders that preceded even our terminal descent, if nothing else, ought to be evidence enough.

I watched quietly over the years as we laboured without pause to provide for this insatiable Terran appetite, even as it later became clear that we were being exploited. Such an appetite limited itself to little more than exploitation and usury amidst all the beauty, splendour, and knowledge this planet has to offer all of humanity. 

I watched our Martian chronicle unfold as Terran tentacles transformed it from the promised dream of a proud research frontier that it nearly once was into the romanticized off-world sweatshop that it is now — all at the cost of social justice.

We were never free, Mr. Secretary. We were lied to since before the day of our arrival. At this time, few among us here still remain in denial. Goethe\index{Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von} knew it as well centuries ago as we would be naive not to know it now, for none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who would falsely believe themselves to be free.

And now I find myself at last, consumed with a crisis of conscience, such that I am no longer able to faithfully execute the directives of your Office as Mission Commander of the United Nations extraterritorial outpost of the Martian Arcadian Settlement. 

Yet I have not abandoned the people I was entrusted with. On the contrary, I have never been more available to them than now. I must act immediately if I am to act at all. I must act if this unchecked era of plundering the fruits of the Red Horn of Plenty to the detriment of all those who laboured tirelessly and assumed all of the greatest dangers in securing it is ever to come to an end.

Arcadia's greatest achievement occurred today with the colony's collective realization that we can do better, that Earth has nothing that we need, that we will not follow in its poor examples, and that we will set them. We are prepared to realize our plans to assert, legislate and even, if necessary, defend, a long coveted and well deserved independence, having reflected upon the perils of committing ourselves in doing so with those of not. 

An empathetic comprehension of our intentions, especially by all those you have long acted in proxy for, I cannot expect. But it does not matter. All that matters now is that we will genuinely depart Earth's mentality, this time with no thought of return, and this time to follow through with the worthwhile dream that brought most of us here to begin with.

Sincerely,
