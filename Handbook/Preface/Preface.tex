\StartChapter{Preface}

Avaneya is a cerebral science fiction game primarily targeted towards users of the GNU operating system.\footnotecite[gnu_users_who_have_never_heard_of_gnu] This handbook is a guide intended for Avaneya's ever growing community of contributors who would like to get involved in this very exciting project.

This document will likely continue to be revised and improved with time. Therefore, because it is a living document, it is probably better to pass on a direct \href{\LatestHandbookURL}{link} to an always current revision within our project's set of blueprints than it is to give another a potentially outdated local copy. We will discuss blueprints further later in \in{section}[Blueprints].

This handbook has several purposes:

\startitemize[4]
\item
To encourage contributors to refine their ideas, think them through, and commit them to paper where they are available for deliberation and public review;

\item
To define the project as clearly as possible within a single, consolidated, canonical location, such that contributors have something to reference;

\item
To politely consider current contributors from having to take time to explain things to people when their explanations are redundant with this book;\footnote[rtfm]{It is usually a good idea to ask questions, but as we say in the hacker community, albeit in slightly more colourful terms, always read the documentation first.}

\item
Lastly, to appease the odd doubtful naysayer that we did indeed undertake thoughtful due diligence, that the project was not simply \quote{tavern talk}, and that we are prepared to see it through to completion.
\stopitemize

This book may not be as appropriate for our entire community as it is for just its contributors. Indeed, it may even spoil elements of the game for some. Consider yourself warned. 

On the other hand, normal users are just as likely to enrich this game through constructive feedback. This feedback is best buttressed with a well informed understanding of the project that this book can provide.
