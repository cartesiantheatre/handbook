\StartChapter{Closing Remarks}

This was a difficult book to write. It forced us to commit our thoughts to paper. This caused us to reflect on, examine, redesign, and refine them as they came out. Had it not been for you, this process would probably never have happened as carefully as we tried to make it.

There is an assumption in conventional schools of economics that you are best modelled as passive cattle there to graze. We believed that assumption needs to go. This project reminds all of us that we do not have to limit ourselves to being merely relays or repeaters of culture, technology, and information; terminal {\it bit sinks}\index{bit sink} or passive receptacles for another's energy, {\it consumers}, but that we can also be {\it generators}. We need not wait on anyone. This is the spirit of {\it libre} culture.

On behalf of all of us, we would like to extend our gratitude for your having taken the time to study this project comprehensively. Avaneya has an exciting future ahead of it. We hope that you will choose to be a part of it.
