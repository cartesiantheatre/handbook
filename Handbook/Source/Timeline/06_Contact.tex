Arcadia comes under fire from what appears to be orbital shelling directed by UNMEPF's forward observers\footnote{A forward observer is an artilleryman who is in a forward position directly overlooking the area to be shelled. By communicating with an artillery unit, he directs and corrects their fire. He is needed because sometimes the actual artillery does not have direct line of sight with the target.} on the ground. The event marks the first shots ever fired in anger on Mars. The original {\it Arcadia Hall} is successfully targeted and destroyed, though most of the city is deliberately left intact. 

Having realized that the city had been evacuated, MARSCOM relies on their {\it Bhadra I} photographic reconnaissance satellite to identify all possible locations suspected of harbouring the settlers' emergency underground shelter. Phantom targets across the surface of {\it Arcadia Planitia} are hammered from what appears to be the fast moving Phobos for more than an hour every sol over the next twenty sols. There are no casualties.

Between shellings, Arda has personnel from the {\it 3\high{rd} People's Own Arcadian Combat Support Engineers} erect a rudimentary high-gain directional antenna. This circumvents the need for access to a satellite communication relay normally necessary to transmit back to Earth by instead relying on S-band microwaves. 

Arda explains to anyone able to receive him on Earth what is happening on Mars. He suspects that the average Terran has probably been left in the dark by their governments and mainstream media. He describes the United Nations' shelling campaign as an attack on peaceful and defenceless civilians levied from a manned orbital installation on Phobos. This installation has apparently been functioning as an orbital artillery battery. He claims that their intentions are to force the settlers to surrender so that the settlers resume applying themselves and their extensive expertise as needed for the resumption of exports under a newly restructured administration.

Arda references a document hacked from a UNSA intranet as evidence of the battery's existence. He had received it prior to Arcadia having lost solnet connectivity when UNSA's {\it METO} communications satellite was taken out. The document was part of the dossier he received from the anonymous tip-off that had revealed the United Nations' intentions for use of force. It is titled {\it Project Horizon: A UNSA Study for the Establishment of a Phobos Artillery Battery}.

The detailed white paper, complete with schematics, describes the first orbital artillery battery ever put into service. The classified document details an ambitious covert UNSA project to construct what it refers to as the {\it Thor Battery}. The outpost is apparently manned by a garrison of a single platoon of thirty soldiers, powered by three nuclear reactors, and located on and within the Martian moon Phobos.

...The Phobos outpost is required to develop and protect strategic UNSA administered interests on Mars; to develop techniques in Phobos and general orbital-based surveillance of Mars, in communications relay, and in operations on the surface of Mars; to serve as a base for exploration of Phobos, for further exploration into space and for military operations on Phobos if required; and to support scientific investigations on Phobos...

\stopTimelineGeneralDocument

Construction was feasible due to the moon's composition. From the surface down to to the first one-hundred metres, the moon is covered with a very fine regolith. The remaining solid material beneath it is of a mostly porous composition. These two characteristics allowed for a straightforward excavation in ensuring that most of the installation could remain subterranean.

Arda provides high resolution imagery taken from the Martian surface a month prior with the transmission as evidence. The images clearly depict an outpost still under construction. He explains that the outpost was originally not intended for active service yet, but rather as part of a long term United Nations' insurance policy for dealing with \quote{\it the distinct possibility of future settlement anomalies}, should the need ever arise. This option was on the table, but only to be taken seriously well after, as MARSCOM had expected, a straightforward capture of Arcadia with the expectation that its inhabitants would not be capable of defending themselves.

Arda illustrates that by exploiting a legal loophole in the {\it Outer Space Treaty}, the {\it Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty}, and the {\it Mars Treaty} whose draftings predated the advent of kinetic bombardment weapons, UNSA believes it is justified in targeting the surface with hypersonic tungsten rods with surgical precision at downward velocities of 10 km/s. The treaties do not observe kinetic bombardment as weapons of mass destruction since they require no explosive payload, though they deliver sufficient kinetic energy in the order of a small tactical nuclear weapon.

The transmission is picked up on Earth by amateur radio operators and quickly disseminated over solnet peer-to-peer networks. Though mainstream media do not acknowledge the transmission, dissemination is sufficiently rapid and widespread that Terran citizenry are best described as mostly of a mixture of fury and disgust at the actions of their respective government's involvement. Amnesty International calls for a public inquiry with powers of subpoena as well as the presence of Red Cross observers on the ground.

UNSA dismisses Arda's claims as \quote{\it baseless allegations propagated by Terran conspiracy theorists, intertwined with a misunderstanding of the nature of meteorite strikes on Mars, used to justify the theft and reckless destruction of a costly set of off-world public assets}. A UNSA spokesman refuses to respond to existential questions over with the now controversial Phobos based outpost. 

The subject is controversial since the exposure of a clandestine orbital installation, if the sensitive document Arda had cited is genuine, provides strong evidence that there were ulterior motives behind the {\it Avaneya Initiative}, given that the purpose of the {\it Thor Outpost} clearly has little to do with sustainability research. This observation increases in popularity on Earth and helps to promote Terran support for Arcadians as the public consciousness revisits Arcadia's rationale for their declaration of independence.

A column of UNMEPF armour and mechanized infantry are spotted approaching the city by Arcadian Militia. The former is halted when concealed elements of the {\it 2\high{nd} People's Own Arcadian Dragoons} fire a warning shot. The shell lands several hundred metres ahead of the column. The dragoon squadron has strict rules of engagement to not allow UNMEPF forces to cross a perimeter extending two kilometres outward from the elevated rim of Arcadia's surrounding impact crater.

A subsonic aircraft crashes 40 km south of RAP Starport carrying 3600 kg of cocaine in the plains of {\it Arcadia Planitia}. The transportation secretary's investigators confirm that the aircraft's tailnumber was registered to the CIA for alleged UNSA diplomatic flights. Chemical analysis suggests it to be the first known synthetic cocaine and of Martian origin.
