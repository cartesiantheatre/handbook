Avaneya has an extensive unit tree as part of its game mechanics. Although the user may be acting at times as president of the republic, not all units can be built and controlled by the user. Some only the world itself can create. As an example, you can and should build a greenhouse, but only the computer can build a Clown Food\index{Clown Food} restaurant. Nevertheless, non-playable units can usually be influenced by the decisions that you make. Nearly everything influences everything in the game. 

But most units can and will change with time depending on various environmental factors that take place in the game world. For example, zone an area for residential usage and it may only have a pressurized yurt or two to start with, but after time, it may develop into a full fledged pressurized biodome.
