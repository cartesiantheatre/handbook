% Rubicon Act's notable portions summarized...
\startarticle
\item % Article I

...declares the colony an independent, sovereign, self--governed, constitutional republic with the right to self determination. It is self--styled the {\it Republic of Arcadia Planitia (RAP)}, colloquially known by its capital and sole city, {\it Arcadia}. The United Nations claimed this area fell within a UN extraterritorial mandate, acknowledging it only as the Arcadian Settlement.

\item % Article II

...defines the head of state, the President. The President and his secretaries are democratically elected and serve for as long as the electorate permit. Since Arcadia is only a single city at this time, there is no large legislative assembly defined akin to a congress of sorts as sometimes found in the governance of nations of greater size.

\item % Article III

...discharges all of Arcadia's public debt currently held by the {\it International Monetary Fund} and the {\it World Bank}, ceasing interest payments effective immediately. A debt limit is imposed and the borrowing of money for public use can be done, but only against the public's credit and without accruing interest.

The Terran central banks had been using the settlers' registered biological property, that is, their UN issued extraterritorial birth certificates, and the security of the bearer's labour as monetized collateral against a debt that preceded the settlement's very existence. This was done without the knowledge or consent of the bearer.

\item % Article IV

...defines an independent judiciary whose judges are democratically elected. They serve for as long as the electorate permit.

\item % Article VII

...superannuates the Terran bancor fiat currency with the {\it jenya}, a rhodium standard. The new hard currency consists of platinum metals more rare and valued than gold. It is declared the exclusive legal tender within the Republic, necessitating all Terran interests acquire Arcadian goods and services exclusively in jenyas.

\item % Article VIII

...defines the state's disposition on personal arms and defence. The constitution provides that the right of the people to responsibly bear arms must never be infringed, but that this is done principally as a safe guard for the protection of the people from either their own government, or that of another's -- but not for validating vigilante justice.

The creation of a permanent standing military force at the government's disposal is strictly forbidden. The raising of militias, however, is permitted.

The militia has many restrictions. Ultimate executive authority over the chain of command must be vested exclusively in none other than the people of the republic, not its government. It cannot be used to persecute, suppress, or marginalize any peaceful demographic. It is forbidden from deployment outside of Arcadia's territorial regions. Its purpose is exclusively defensive -- of people, but of neither government nor private interests. Other restrictions include that its commissioned and enlisted ranks must be drawn exclusively from Arcadian citizenry; that membership among these ranks remain strictly voluntary; and that it shall not exercise a separate legal framework of military law distinct from other citizens. It cannot be garrisoned or deployed domestically as an aid to civil power under any circumstance, be it real or contrived.

\item % Article IX

...denies the deployment of munitions of war, suborbital, orbital, in outer space, or anywhere outside of Arcadia's territorial regions.

...enumerates the fundamental freedoms and human rights Arcadians enjoy with respect to their new state. They are adaptations from Earth's former {\it European Convention on Human Rights} drafted in 1950 A.D.. These articles include the
