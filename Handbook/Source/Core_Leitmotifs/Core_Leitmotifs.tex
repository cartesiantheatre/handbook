% Core Leitmotifs chapter...
\StartChapter{Core Leitmotifs}

This is probably the most important chapter in the entire book in helping you to decide whether this is the project for you to be involved in or not. Avaneya has several recurring ideas or {\it leitmotifs}\index{leitmotif} it adopts. The following form the core set the project feels are important to consider and reflect on, given in no particular order.

We would like to keep the leitmotif set as minimal as reasonably possible, with everything else that we feel might be relevant, it hopefully already being possible to derive from something present already in the core set. However, if you still feel the set should be modified in some way, please bring it up on any of the project crew communication methods related in \in{section}[Communication]. We are open minded, but, like us, you must also be prepared to rationally substantiate your argument.

\item
People behave less free as they become less informed.\footnote{See {\it The Equality Trust} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
The axioms neo-classical economics presupposes, such as the viability infinite growth linear models\footnote{See {\it Adbusters} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone], with prejudice for \href{http://www.adbusters.org/cultureshop/backissues/85}{Issue \#85}.} decoupled from, yet embodied within, a finite environment, and the absence of true cost accounting\footnote{See {\it Food, Inc.}, in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone] as well as the \about[Genuine Progress Indicator].} are fundamentally fraudulent.\footnote{See Adbuster's \href{http://anticap.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/jamming-neoclassical-economics/}{Jamming neoclassical economics} campaign.}

\item
Government is inherently dangerous.\footnote{See {\it Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder since 1900 (Macht Und Gesellschaft, Bd. 2)} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
Most major acts of terrorism are staged by government.\footnote{See {\it Debunking 9/11 Debunking} and the {\it Open Letter to Minister of Public Safety} written by a member of this project in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
Governments are generally not there to make changes to serve the public interest. They are there to keep things the same.\footnote{See {\it Report From Iron Mountain: On The Possibility And Desirability Of Peace} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
Most diseases that afflict mankind are caused by our diet.\footnote{See {\it The China Study} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
The presence of the most dangerous recreational narcotics in society are generally attributable to government, either overtly, as in the case of alcohol,\footnote{See {\it Drug Harms in the UK: a Multicriteria Decision Analysis} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone]} or covertly, as in the case of cocaine.\footnote{\href{http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j6QonBKKMo2gw1e3ql-xUcQEZbVg}{Mexico Drug Plane Used for CIA rendition Flights. }{\it Associated Free Press}. 4 Sep. 2008.}\footnote{\href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT5MY3C86bk}{Former LA Police Officer Mike Ruppert Confronts CIA Director John Deutch on Drug Trafficking}. {\it YouTube}. 15 Nov. 1996.}

\item
Agriculture is our principle means of interacting with the planet. Changing what we eat solves many global problems.\footnote{See {\it Food, Inc.} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
Fractional reserve central banking is fraud.\footnote{See {\it The Creature From Jekyll Island} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
Usury is the most ubiquitous, sophisticated, and least recognized form of contemporary slavery.\footnote{{\it Ibid.}}

\item
Bestowing corporations with the rights of human beings is dangerous.\footnote{See {\it The Corporation} in \in{chapter}[Resources For Everyone].}

\item
Very little of what we call human nature is genetic. Our genes specify human needs, not behaviour.\footnote{See \about[Socioeconomic Modelling].}

\item
Everything is connected and nothing happens in a vacuum.\footnote{We think this is reasonable to take axiomatically.}

If you have gotten thus far, and you are still comfortable being involved in this project, then you will probably find it rewarding. Otherwise, there is no sense in being here. No one is forcing you to do anything. This is not a project for everyone and there are countless other community driven projects that could probably use your talents.

But regardless of whatever {\it you} choose to do, creativity is required whenever we present the aforementioned. We always try to require the users to do some thinking of their own to arrive at these conclusions themselves. As Socrates once said, {\it I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think}.
