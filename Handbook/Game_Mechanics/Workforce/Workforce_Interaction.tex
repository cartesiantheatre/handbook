\StartSubSection{Group Dynamics}

A group is 2 or more units together within a set vicinity undertaking the same task/action. Groups can be longer term, called static, or brief and fleeting, called fluid.

%Static vs Fluid
Static groups are groups a unit will be in over an extended period of time, they will either meet with members or this group regularaly or seek them out. Examples of static groups are families, co-workers at work, and friends. 

Fluid groups are groups formed spontaneiously and that only last for a short duration or single event. Examples of fluid groups are people meeting in the street and chatting, or large group events such as protests or concerts.


%properties of a group
-Id number.
-Units in group.



%Forming friendship groups / fuild groups on like interests.
Friendship groups form when units meet by chance or as part of another group and have ... number of workforce variables in common, more variables leeds to a stronger friendship. Same interests increase the friendship further. 
%Limit of number of friendship groups.
%Units will dump friendship groups in favour of better ones.
%Unit will make or attempt to make contact with well liked units they are in a friendship group in order to meet belonging need. Fulfilment determined by number of interests/variabls shared, and if activity engaged in is one of these interests.



%Family Groups


%Work Groups


Static groups things like work and family, remain for longer periods of time.

multiple interests alike, the units will be more frienyl and therefore make permient friend groups.
Perma group eating and another unit attends and has same interests, this unit will join group

?Larger groups require more interests the same?
?Do interests, degree or amounts of importance or involvment that draws groups?

some groups will have members come and go, like companies. 
Some groups will disolve.

can multiple groups cross over or are groups exclusive? Probably need to have cross over, or can groups be focused on current activity.

%How families are formed
%How groups are formed
%Groups being companies
%Businesses as groups


%Notes so far:
Units together doing things form group bubbles (bubbles is just a descriptor at this stage).
Units move between groups throughout day/time. 
They enter groups to fulfil needs, act on interests, or out of routine (whatever routine is).
Group 'bubbles' grow and shrink as units come and go.
Units who enter work group/business group contribute to productivity. 

Group types - as in family, work, etc:
Family, living, support
Work, company, productivity
Friends, interests, fun, belonging
