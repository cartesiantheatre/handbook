You'll need ConTeXt Minimal installed to build the handbook. Here are
instructions for installing it from source on a variety of different
platforms:

If you are running Ubuntu, Adam Reviczky <adam.reviczky@kcl.ac.uk> 
was kind enough to provide us with a PPA. Consider yourself warned,
however, that Adam's build recipe pulls from the latest upstream
source on a daily basis which means ConTeXt may work one day and be
busted to shit on another:

    <https://launchpad.net/~reviczky/+archive/ppa>

You will also need the texlive-math-extra and ttf-ubuntu-font-family 
packages. To do all of the above on Ubuntu, run the following:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:reviczky/ppa
    $ sudo aptitude update
    $ sudo aptitude install     \
        umbrello                \
        texlive-math-extra      \
        ttf-ubuntu-font-family  \
        context                 \
        context-extra           \
        context-fonts-extra

Once you have the dependencies installed, simply run the following 
within Avaneya/Documentation/Contributors/Handbook:

    $ make

If everything went well, you should have the Avaneya Project Crew Handbook.pdf 
sitting in the aforementioned folder ready to go.
