\StartChapter{Preface}

This book is a living document. It is probably better to pass on a link to another in its original location\footnote[]{See \in{section}[Revision Control Management] for details.} under our Bazaar version control management than it is to send a copy of the book directly. This is because it will likely continue to be revised and improved with time.

This handbook has several purposes:

\startitemize[n]
\item
To define the Avaneya project as clearly as possible so that everyone involved understands it;

\item
To provide this project definition in a single, consolidated, canonical location;

\item
To politely consider those already engaged from having to explain things redundant with this handbook.\footnote[rtfm]{It is usually a good idea to ask questions. But as we say in the hacker community, read the documentation first.}
\stopitemize

This book is probably not as useful to normal users as it is to contributors. It may even spoil elements of the game for the former. On the other hand, normal users are just as likely to enrich the game through constructive feedback which is best buttressed when coming from an understanding of the project.
