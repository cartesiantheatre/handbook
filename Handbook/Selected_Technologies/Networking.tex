\head {\em ENet}

ENet provides the low level API which Avaneya's multiplayer protocol is built on. Its purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple, and robust network communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). It is very useful in providing optional reliable in--order delivery of packets. 

It omits certain higher level networking features such as authentication, lobbying, server discovery, encryption (which can be provided with OpenSSL), or other similar tasks that are particularly application specific. This is done deliberately so that the library remains flexible, portable, and easily embeddable.

\head {\em OpenSSL}

The OpenSSL Library is a {\it libre} implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols. It is used to provide encryption at the application level to make it more difficult for an uninvited third party to be a nuisance.
