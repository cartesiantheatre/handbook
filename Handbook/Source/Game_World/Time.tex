\StartSection{Time}

Time keeping in Avaneya is different from how it is kept on Earth. It is useful to be familiar with this for understanding both the gameplay, storyline, and user interface design.

\StartSubSection{Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, and Years}

% Timezones...
Until Arcardia's independence in 0 A.R., the crater Airy-0 had been the prime meridian since 1969 A.D. based on early photographs provided by the Mariner 6 and 7 missions. Following that, Arcadians superannuated it using Arcadia as the new prime meridian. But as was the case prior to that happening, there still remained 24 timezones, but different only in that they were offset relative to Arcadia which is situated within {\it Coordinated Mars Time\index{Coordinated Mars Time}\index{MTC}} (MTC), akin to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)\index{Greenwich Mean Time}\index{GMT}.

% Explain seconds, minutes, and hours...
A Martian second, minute, and hour are still the same as their Terran counterparts (e.g. a Martian hour is still 3600 Terran seconds).

% Explain solar day...
A {\it sol\index{sol}} is a solar day.\footnote{A {\it yestersol\index{yestersol}} being the sol preceding the current one.} This is the Martian analogue to a Terran day, but 2.7 \% longer. The conversion of 1.027491 Terran days to Martial sols means that a sol is slightly longer than on Earth. Martian clocks are therefore designed to {\it time slip} at midnight for 39 minutes, 40 seconds. This allows Arcadians to use a 24 hour clock which they are accustomed to.

% Explain year...
A Martian year, abbreviated {\it MYr} and pronounced "m-year", contains 668.6 sols, or 689 days by a terrestrial metric. That means there are 88775.245 seconds in a Martian year with 1.8876712 Martian years for every Terran year (1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours). These years are enumerated relative to a temporal datum, as described in \in{chapter}[Timeline].

\StartSubSection{Calendar}

The colonists use a different calendar than on Earth for both practical and political reasons. The practical reason is that the Gregorian calendar is useless in a world where the orbital period, seasons, and length of a solar day are different than those of Earth. The calendar's months, for instance, are not meaningful in the absence of the natural cycles of the Earth's Moon. As a consequence, they needed a calender that is meaningful to the physical idiosyncrasies of their own planet.

The political reason is partly because the original Arcadians were predominantly secular, the Gregorian calendar's year zero being theological in nature. The other reason is that they desired a calendar which was meaningful in the context of {\it their own} indigenous history.

In terms of the practical reason given, had the equipartitioned Terran months been brought to Mars, they would not be of equal length because the Martian orbit has high eccentricity. In orbital mechanics, this is the degree an orbital path deviates from a perfect circle to form an ellipse. Kepler's second law states that the line adjoining a planet with the Sun sweep through equal areas in equal time. This means its seasons are not of equal length because it speeds up when it gets close to the Sun and slows down as it gets more distant.

Since its seasons, and therefore months, are not of equal length, to be useful, a calendar must be divided such that equal segments correspond to equal angles about the Sun so one can predict the seasons. The Arcadians kept the familiar concept of twelve months, so each one therefore still remains \math{30^{\circ}} (\math{360^{\circ} / 12 = 30^{\circ}}). The difference with their Terran counterparts is the the frame of reference they chose.

In ancient times, Terrans of a geocentric view named the months after whatever zodiacal constellation the Sun, as seen from Earth, appeared to be positioned in. The Arcadians, now having to reconcile the fact that Earth is no longer the only place our solar system harbours humans, they instead chose a more universal heliocentric view by using the location of Mars in the zodiac as seen {\it from} the Sun, as opposed to the Terran inverse. This is possible because the zodiac is physically meaningful for any planet within our solar system, since all of our solar system's planets lie in the same orbital plane. As such, the zodiac also furnishes the Arcadian calendar with names of their months.

This system of a Martian calendar previously described adopted by the Arcadians had been proposed by aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin (see \in{section}[Mars Direct]). The calendar looks as follows in \in{table}[table:Martian Months].

In case you are unfamiliar with the concept of the solstice and equinox, a solstice happens twice a year when the Sun's apparent position in the sky reaches its northernmost or southernmost extremes. The equinox also happens twice a year, but when the tilt of Earth's axis is inclined neither away from nor towards Sun, the Sun's centre being in same plane as the planet's equator.

As an example, a date expressed by an Arcadian could be Virgo 7, 32 A.R. for the seventh day of the fourth month, Virgo, of the thirty-second Martian year following the republic. See \in{chapter}[Timeline] for an explanation of the suffix following the year.
