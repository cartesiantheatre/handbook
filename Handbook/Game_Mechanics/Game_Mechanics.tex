\StartChapter{Game Mechanics}
Having familiarized yourself with the game world, leading characters, and the fictional timeline, you are probably still left to wonder how the {\it user} fits into all of this. This chapter will attempt to provide as complete a picture as possible of the interactive aspects of the game. Bear in mind that this is highly susceptible to change, given that we will surely come up with new ideas and revise old ones as we progress through the game's implementation.
