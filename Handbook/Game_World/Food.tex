\StartSection{Food}

What people eat affects them in more ways than in satisfying their personal preferences. What we eat profoundly affects our quality of life, intelligence,\footnotecite[cbc2013_toxic_sugar]\footnotecite[case_against_fluoride] as well as our surrounding economic, environmental, and political contexts.\footnotecite[food_inc] The way we grow food is one of the principle ways we interact with our own planet. This section will discuss some of the considerations for a Martian diet and what is necessary for growing healthy food on the Red Planet.

\StartSubSection{Interplanetary Travel}
During the flight to Mars, it is critical that the crew eat properly \index{nutrition}because sickness is also a mission liability. This is more so in space than on Earth because the traditional allopathic approach to the treatment of illness is even less effective in space\footnotecite[drugs_ineffective_in_space] than it already is on Earth.\footnotecite[lazarou1998_adr]

\StartSubSection{Politics}
Depending on the political circumstance and the most influential elements in policy making, some foods will be considered acceptable at some times, possibly even illegal at others. For example, influential elements acting through UNSA may attempt to pass legislation that bans or controls any number of unpatentable herbs known to have useful pharmacological properties.

\StartSubSection{Dietary Considerations}
The raising of \index{warm--blooded herbivores}warm--blooded herbivores for food is pointless both in space and on Mars. There are reasons why one does not see poultry on the International Space Station. It is an extremely energy inefficient method of producing food. Most of the energy that goes in to warm--blooded herbivores is bled off or radiated into space long before it reaches us as food.

In addition, tillable land is not free. Adapting the land for the large agricultural purposes necessary for the raising of warm--blooded herbivores is energy intensive on Mars. This, and a long list of other reasons, ensure that it is simply too expensive to {\it responsibly} prepare them for human consumption. Besides, and more to the point, there is a great deal of evidence that suggests that, not only do we not require their consumption, doing so is actually quite harmful to us.\footnotecite[the_china_study]

There are other inherent advantages to a whole foods plant--based diet on Mars. The lower Martian gravity means plants require less energy to transport water and other nutrients up their stems than they would on Earth. The planting of \index{orchards}orchards are useful not only for providing fruit, but in doubling in providing a colony with a source of wood for furniture or other uses.

\StartSubSection{Gasses}
The gas pressure and its constituents in the greenhouses are critical for supporting the growth of plant life. Thankfully plants only require a minimum of 5.0 kPa to grow, although this is far too low for direct human exposure (need a minimum of 6.8 kPa -- with a respirator). This has a number of advantages in the design of Martian buildings as discussed already in \in{section}[Buildings].

Assuming the greenhouse is rated to only 6.8 kPa, which is both economical and very light, the partial pressures should include \chemical{N_2} at 3.0 kPa, \chemical{O_2} at 2.5 kPa, \chemical{H_2O} vapour at 1.2 kPa, and \chemical{CO_2} at 0.1 kPa. The \chemical{CO_2} levels in the greenhouse limit plant life since it is their primary nutrient. 

By adding water to Martian regolith, it should react with the peroxide in it to evolve \chemical{O_2}. This could be useful as one way of obtaining the initial supply on the frontier.

\StartSubSection{Hydroponics}
Hydroponics are probably not a good idea at first because they require a lot of water. Getting water takes a lot of work in the beginning of a new settlement. After infrastructure is built up, it would then be a better option.

\StartSubSection{Lighting}
Plants require light for photosynthesis to function. Indoor artificial lighting is too energy inefficient for crops. Greenhouse domes are a better option because they are open to natural sunlight. Although the Martian solar flux is only 40\% of what is received on Earth, this is still sufficient for plants.

\StartSubSection{Mushrooms}
Mushroom ranches have a very practical application on Mars. As with any crop, not all of it is actually consumed. There is always some waste. If the plant waste is fed to mushrooms, they can turn up to 70\% of it into a high quality source of protein. They do not require any sunlight, but only a dark warm room with a little bit of oxygen.

\StartSubSection{Regolith}

Martian regolith is actually more nutrient rich than Earth's. The only nutrient it is lacking is potassium which can easily be acquired from any dry shore or former water body. It is loosely packed, porous, and mechanically supportive of plants.

The pH is about 8.3, which is too alkaline for most plants that prefer a pH between 6 to 7.5. \index{smectite clays}Smectite clays are found to be naturally occurring in the regolith and can be useful for buffering and stabilizing the pH into a slightly acidic range. They double in being able to store exchangeable nutrient ions within them as well.

Nitrates are needed as a fertilizer. Unfortunately they are not in all Martian regolith. Raw molecular nitrogen could be extracted from the atmosphere of 3\% if need be. This can be done by combining it with hydrogen as \chemical{N_2, +, 3H_2, ->, 2NH_3}. If that is not a viable option, an alternative is to look for existing natural nitrate beds which can provide truck loads of fertilizer.

There is a concern, however, that the top layer of regolith is too saturated with antioxidants (oxygen ions) from the intense ultraviolet radiation it receives from the Sun. These atoms will destroy organic molecules, such as plants, which are the building blocks of life. More thought is required on this to find a constructive solution for the settlers.

\StartSubSection{Merits of Kelp Fertilizer}
It is important that soils are not nutritionally deficient. Deficient soils make for deficient plants. Deficient plants have deficient self--defence against pests. This gives agribusiness an excuse to provide disgruntled farmers with toxic pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, larvicides, and so on. 

These deficient plants make for deficient foods. Deficient foods make for deficient human health. Advocates for the consumption of animal products must remember that even if one supplements their died with the consumption of animals or animal products, deficient plants fed to deficient animals still make for deficient people.\footnotecite[food_matters]

Despite what the agricultural industry would have you believe, and what many of us were taught in school, plants actually require far more than simply nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (\chemical{N}, \chemical{P}, and \chemical{K}). They need around 52 different minerals, depending on how one counts them. Three is just the bare minimum necessary to make fake food that looks real enough to sell. Thus, we are in need of a viable solution for healthy soils in a Martian environment.

Various forms of algae have been considered many times as a food in off--world use, such as in the design of the first American Lunar military base.\footnotecite[extras={ p.~50.}][project_horizon_volume_2] But phytoplankton, such as kelp, is just as valuable as a food for people as it is for plants as an excellent fertilizer.

Kelp fertilizer is a powerful natural technology that is rich in every trace element that plants may need only a little of. It also contains the usual full spectrum of soil nutrients at 0.3\% nitrogen, 0.1\% phosphorus, and 1.0\% potassium, along with a full range of trace elements and amino acids. Further, it provides all of these things in ideal ratios.

Besides its contents, kelp fertilizer has many other benefits. Unlike plant composts, it does not introduce the foreign seeds of weeds. It breaks down quickly because it contains very little cellulose. It also contains hormones which improve cellular development of plant leaves, flowers, and fruit. It has a higher photosynthetic efficiency than terrestrial plants which means that it produces more of its own biomass from the same amount of light. Its jelly like alginate helps to bind together loose soil. Seed germination is improved and the resulting plants develop more extensive root systems. This means they will have healthier foliage, flowers, fruit, and therefore food. Lastly, they will have a greater natural resistance to nematodes, disease, and other pests.

Delivery is simple. Once the kelp is ready, it is not necessary to rinse it before use in either soil or directly on the plants. The latter \index{foliar dispersal method}foliar dispersal method works by spraying the liquid fertilizer directly on to the plant's leaves. This is up to 20 times more effective in supplying nutrients when the soil is of a poor quality or if the roots are stressed from transplant shock, extreme heat, or drought conditions.

\StartSubSection{Photobioreactors}
To produce kelp on Mars, a \index{photobioreactor}{\it photobioreactor} can be used. It consists of a tank made of either glass, polyethylene, or some other suitable material. Various equipment to support the growth of the phytoplankton inside the tank is needed.

A \index{computer+photobioreactor}computer is necessary to regulate and provide the temperature, lighting, pH, sterilized water, air, \chemical{CO_2}, and all other nutrients at the correct rates. The nutrients primarily include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as silica, iron, and many other trace minerals which are not difficult to find on Mars. 

Photosynthesis provides the organism with the energy it requires to sustain itself. This reaction is described in \in{reaction}[reaction:photosynthesis].

At the bottom of the tank, a dead coral bed provides detritus for the kelp roots to take hold of. This could be dehydrated coral plankton. Only a small seed piece is actually necessary to get it started which could be imported. For deeper ponds, the bottom of the tank will need to be agitated, either with bubbles or with a paddle wheel.

Fluorescent lighting could be used, but only with the right bulbs. Direct sunlight, however, is too strong for kelp and most other algae. This is because these species evolved in an underwater environment where they could only expect one--tenth of what a typical plant exposed to direct sunlight would receive on land. This is a useful property to take advantage of because Mars receives only 40\% of the solar flux Earth receives anyways. 

The lighting system could be embedded directly into the tank by using \index{glow plates}glow plates. During periods of little or no solar energy, the computer can activate the fluorescent lighting elements embedded in the glow plates. When there is sufficient solar energy, it can save electrical energy by routing the sunlight to the glow plates through fibre optics. This would make for a beautiful lighting effect for the photobioreactor farm's model during the solar day and night cycles.
