\StartSection{Units & Controllers}

A unit is any vehicle, building, or other special object that needs to have its own unique properties and behaviours. It will always have a {\it controller}. This could be a human, either the user or someone else during a multiplayer session, or the computer's artificial intelligence.

It is the project's desire for an extensive unit tree. Although the user may direct the locations and activities of units under their control, not all units in the unit tree they will have access to -- nor will they necessarily even know about or want them. Some units, such as certain types of vehicles and buildings, only the computer can create when appropriate. We refer to these as non-playable units\index{Non-playable units} (NPUs)\index{NPUs}. At other times still, the user will be able to create certain units in specific scenarios that in others they would not.

As an example, you can and should build a greenhouse. But other influences in the game world might have the Clown Food\index{Clown Food} franchise erect a restaurant without having asked if the circumstance was right. Nevertheless, NPUs can usually be influenced by the decisions that you make, even if you are not directly in control of them. Nearly everything influences everything in the game.

But most units can and will change with time depending on various factors that take place in the game world. For example, an area zoned for residential usage may start with only a few pressurized yurts, but after time, it may develop into an extravagant, full fledged, pressurized biodome. With further time yet, it may fall into a state of disrepair with the underprivileged seeking shelter within its ruins - should the social, economic, and other conditions be met.

Let us take a look at some of the different categories that form the basic user unit tree. This is a very modest subset of all units possible and does not illustrate the variety each unit can express. The user can usually create any of these.
