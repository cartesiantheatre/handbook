\StartSubSection{Fees and Ordinance}
Fees are closely related to taxation in that they take from individuals or business' for their actions or existence within the city. Ordinance are the guidlines, rules, or standards by which the city is to be held.

Fees generate income for the city whereas ordinance forms the rules or laws that allow fees to be obtained for or from certain activites. While ordinance can generate income, for the most part ordinance is seen as measures which improve a city's function and quality at a financial cost. Some examples of fees may include rates and road tolls whereas ordinance might include allocating special permits for land use and allocating resources for a neighbourhood watch.

Both fees and ordinance can be implemented in broad strokes to individuals and companies or can be micro managed to fine detail, focusing only on certain groups or city areas (similar to methods discussed in taxation).
