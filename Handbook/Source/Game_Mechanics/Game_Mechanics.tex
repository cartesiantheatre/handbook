\StartChapter{Game Mechanics}
Having familiarized yourself with the game world, leading characters, and the background fictional timeline by now, you are probably still left to wonder the role of the {\it user}. This chapter will attempt to provide a complete picture of the interactive aspects of the game. Bear in mind that this is highly susceptible to change, given that we will surely come up with new ideas and revise old ones as we progress through the game's implementation.
