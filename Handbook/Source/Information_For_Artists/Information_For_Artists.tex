Getting the Avaneya game experience right means at least replicating the visual environmental conditions of the Martian landscape as closely as possible. We can do much better than simply making it red, and users appreciate this because it makes the experience feel more genuine.

Since artists depend on their eyes to define an aesthetic experience through tools like Blender, as opposed to readings from a mass spectrometer, it is more important that they know what Martian rocks and a sunrise would look like if they were actually standing there than, say, the peroxide concentration of Martian regolith or the average atmospheric pressure when designing material shaders\index{shader}. This means they must have access to large sets of high resolution reference photographs\index{reference photographs} to study. But Mars, like Earth, is a large place of greatly varied terrain and climate, so we must be more specific.

\about[Arda Baştürk]'s settlers erected their settlement of Arcadia in the Arcadia Planitia region. It is named after the Arcadia region of Ancient Greece, so, in turn, named after the Greek legend of Arcas\index{Arcas}. UNSA selected this location because there is plenty of water ice, a stable climate, and year round sunlight.

The centre of Arcadia Planitia is mostly uniform in appearance, with its centre roughly at \math{46.7^{\circ}}N \math{192.0^{\circ}}E. This is mid-latitude in the Northern hemisphere. 

Images of a fresh meteorite crater 12 metres across taken in 2008 revealed under the surface a massive blanket of water ice.\footnote{\href{http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2009/09/24/tech-space-water-mars-crater.html}{Ice on Mars revealed in fresh craters. }{\it CBC News}. 24 Sep. 2009.} It also turns out fortuitously that this ice is almost completely pure, with only about one percent of it dirt.

Even though there is a great deal of ice on Mars, it is unstable in the thin Martian atmosphere and you rarely ever see it anywhere other than in the polar regions. This is because the ice rapidly sublimates\footnote{When a solid material sublimates, it means it skips melting to a liquid and turns directly into vapour.} as soon as it is exposed.

The region has also experienced recent lava flows. By recent, in a geological time scale, that means within the last few million years. Therefore Mars may still be volcanically active and probably has a molten core, although it does not appear to spin which is why there is no magnetic field - rendering a magnetic compass useless.

Arcadia Planitia's windswept landscape consists of a vast, mostly flat, pale tan coloured plain. It has sand dunes of modest height, never approaching anything higher than a few feet, with small uniformly sized rocks littering the surface. As the prevailing theory goes, these rocks are remnants of some of the underlying bedrock which is an older layer of solidified lava. Every time an asteroid impacts, penetrating the younger upper layer, the underlying bedrock ejecta is scattered everywhere.

Like all other explored regions, it undergoes constant sterilization through intense ultraviolet radiation. This ensures that there is no {\it known} life on the {\it surface} of Mars.

\StartSection{Viking Mission}

In 1976 NASA successfully placed two spacecraft into Martian orbit after many years of failed American and Russian attempts. The Viking Orbiters both carried their own landers which they deployed successfully. They were capable of capturing high resolution photographs and other data from the surface of the planet, buffering temporarily onto internal magnetic tapes, and then relaying the data back to Earth through one the orbiters when it was in position. They provided us with large amounts of data without any issues for four years before finally succumbing to a battery failure on one and a software update bug which shutdown the communication antenna on the other.

At present, no lander has explored Arda's area of settlement, Arcadia Planitia. This would have been a problem for us, except that the neighbouring plains of {\it Utopia Planitia} are very similar in appearance and we have a multitude of images captured by Viking Lander II. It did this from the location of \math{47.7^{\circ}}N \math{225.9^{\circ}}W back on September 3, 1976.

\StartSection{Avaneya: Viking Mission Remastered}

While researching the aesthetics of the Martian surface, we found it incredulous that in all the decades passed since the Viking Landers sent their images back to Earth, there does not appear to be so much as a single, complete, user friendly, archive of all the images. So you can forget downloading a convenient archive of PNGs from NASA's website intended for a layman.

We do, however, have access to the original image source data\footnote{\fullahref{http://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/volumes/viking.html}} from the Viking mission that NASA made available. It was produced by the Science Digital Data Preservation Task at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory by recovering what data they could by copying directly off of old, decaying magnetic tapes onto more stable optical media in the 1990s when CDs first became available. They did not otherwise alter them. They have been provided courtesy of NASA's Planetary Data System and represent EDR (Experimental Data Record), which is a processing level at NASA to denote "raw data" that was returned to Earth as captured by the Viking Lander I/II onboard instrumentation.

And while such raw data is now available to everyone as public domain, nearly all of it is encoded in a useless, archaic, format used during the Viking mission between July 20, 1976 to November 5, 1982. As you might expect, few remain today at NASA to explain its specification.

The {\it Avaneya: Viking Mission Remastered} archive is an effort to remedy this situation constructively. It doubles in giving our artists what they need, and also provides the general public with an invaluable educational resource. The software tool we engineered generates most of our remastered archive in the form of lossless PNG images which everyone already has software that can open. This software is described in greater detail in \in{section}[VikingExtractor]. We used two source data sets as the basis for our new archive.

NASA's {\it Viking Lander High Resolution Mosaics, Stereo Images and Range Data Sets} volumes marked {\tt VL_0001} through {\tt VL_0002} were the first. They are the result of NASA stitching together multiple images to form mosaics. Some of them may be rather Frankensteinian in appearance, but understand that they were intended for operational use in a hectic environment at the time. Fortunately we did not have to do any significant work on this set. We simply made the logical directory layout, file names, and documentation more intuitive. We also got rid of many things that most people, either would have found confusing, or they probably would not have had much use for anyways.

NASA's {\it Viking Lander Processed Images} were the second source. They were taken from the volumes marked {\tt VL_2101} through {\tt VL_2124}. The photographs in this set, after restoration, can be looked at individually, as opposed to forming mosaics. They form the bulk of the archive, but required a great deal of digital forensic archaeology\index{digital forensic archaeology}. This is because NASA was not thinking at the time of a need for a long term image archival strategy\index{image archival strategy}. This is understandable, given the overwhelming excitement and immediate requirements that must have come with getting real data and real photographs of another world.

    {\externalfigure[Source/Information_For_Artists/Images/Viking_Lander_0910.png][][width=.3\textwidth]}

As a consequence, the archaic magnetic tapes the images were stored on began to rot\footnote{Magnetic tapes can experience "bit rot"\index{bit rot} as bits lose magnetic orientation. When stored where it is warm and humid, the tapes can literally rot.} as the years went on. Even if they had been safe on magnetic tapes, the VICAR\index{VICAR} (Video Image Communication and Retrieval)\index{Video Image Communication and Retrieval} format they were encoded in is an ancient format having its origins nearly half a century ago. Moreover, the few remaining functional VICAR image loaders the team managed to access are for much newer file format versions than those used during the Viking era.\footnote{{\tt Xloadimage 4.1} and {\tt ImageMagick 6.7.0} are some examples that can decode newer VICAR data, but not that from the Viking era.}

VICAR was the image processing software used at the time. Unfortunately its specification has gone through many revisions over the decades with little, if any, formal documentation of the format used during the Viking era. The most recent documentation available is from 1994,\footnote{\fullahref{http://www-mipl.jpl.nasa.gov/external/vug/vugfinal.html}} and even that is still too recent to be useful.

The only two image loaders we know of are both held by NASA, both proprietary. The first, {\tt NASAView}, has no source code publicly available, can only export to lossy non-free imaging formats, and its interface is too primitive to allow for batch processing with large image sets in the order of many thousands as we require.

The second we were not permitted access to even the binary. Its distribution is severely restricted. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory informed us that they could {\it "only provide a royalty-free license to universities (signed by a department head) or a government subcontractor, where the requested software is required to support the effort. At the end of the contract, it must be deleted. [They] cannot provide software to individuals or for R&D purposes."} Even if we had been granted access, there is still no guarantee that it could have consumed Viking era imaging data, and even if it could, probably not with the flexibility and automation we require. In all likelihood, after examining the data in detail, there is probable reason to suspect that not even NASA really has anything useful in recovering these images.

\StartSection{VikingExtractor}

In keeping with the {\it software libre} philosophy, we did not wait on proprietary software vendors to hold data access hostage, so we wrote {\tt VikingExtractor}.\footnote{If you would like to explore the {\tt VikingExtractor} source code, see {\tt Avaneya/Tools/VikingExtractor} in the source tree. Access is described in \in{section}[Revision Control Management].} We did this because people should not have to perform digital forensic archaeology to get an idea of what Mars looks like when photos were already taken, paid for with public resources, and have already existed for decades - albeit up in the attic, within a chest, covered in cobwebs, and guarded with a rusted out lock nobody seems to have a key for, at best, or refuses to share, at worst.

Both Viking Landers were equipped with a multipurpose photosensor array (PSA). These early digital cameras contained an array of twelve photosensor diodes, intended for capturing different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum for various purposes. These are described below in \in{table}[table:Viking Lander PSA] with the diode types supported by {\tt VikingExtractor} noted under the Readable column.

Note that the broad band band types are probably not of much interest to most people, so we did not spend time implementing support in {\tt VikingExtractor}.

A great deal of the original data was corrupt (e.g. tape rot) or suffered from inconsistent formatting, making it difficult to write a reliable parser. The general rule of thumb with the Viking Lander data set was that there was no general rule of thumb. You are stuck with a very large heterogeneous mixture of files encoded in {\it ad hoc} formats invented on the fly for a stressed operational environment. However, with the aid of some heuristics and image analysis, the tool is reasonably robust and can tolerate a fair amount of noise. It recovers what it can and skips what it cannot.

The {\it Viking Lander Processed Images} archive, we transcoded with the {\tt VikingExtractor} tool from the volumes containing only images into interlaced lossless PNGs. They were identified based on their photosensor diode band type (e.g. {\tt RED/T} denoting red band data as part of a disassembled colour triplet set, {\tt IR1} for infrared 1, and so on. This metadata is located within all intact EBCDIC\footnote{Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) was an ASCII alternative 8-bit character encoding scheme used mostly on IBM mainframe computers back in the 1950s and 1960s.} encoded headers. These headers are made up of "label records" which were designed and suited for old mainframe computers equipped with magnetic tapes. All of the metadata\footnote{As an example, there was a flag indicating whether the camera lens was cleared of dust with compressed gas prior to shooting. This is not so useful for most, but the {\it VikingExtractor} tool made it trivial to preserve with little effort.} the on-board instrumentation provided can be preserved for the curious.

When relying on the image archive, make sure you are looking at the right place. So if you want to know what Arcadia Planitia looks like, look at its nearest explored neighbour that was explored by the second Viking Lander, {\it Utopia Planitia}. The other lander landed on the other side of the planet on {\it Chryse Planitia}. They look similar to the untrained eye, but they have many subtle differences.
