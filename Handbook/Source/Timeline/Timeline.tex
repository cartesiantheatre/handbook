%c Timeline chapter...
\startchapter{Timeline}

The world Avaneya takes place in is highly self-referential. A fictional timeline is positioned relative to a @dfn{year zero}, with dates preceding suffixed @dfn{B.R.}, before the republic; while those following are suffixed @dfn{A.R.}, after the republic. This is the method adopted by Arda and his settlers. 

Note that a year is defined as a Martian year (MYr) and is not the same as a Terran year. You may want to refer to @ref{Game World Time} for a more detailed explanation on how the settlers keep track of time on Mars.

Year zero's placement relative to the Gregorian calendar is deliberately never given. But inferentially, one can reason it is proximate enough for a contemporary audience to feel relevant, yet distant enough to afford some creative licenses.

Its 140 tonnes capability separates from the manned module in low Earth orbit. It carries a crew of four with two flight engineers and two mechanics with combined specialities in geology and biogeochemistry. This is the first attempted piloted mission to Mars and implements the Mars Direct mission architecture as a direct launch.

The United Nations holds the Second International Mars Summit in Geneva, Switzerland, with the purpose of discussing the options on the table for the second manned mission to Mars. The attendees number in the thousands, representing the states of the African Union, North American Union, European Union, and the Asian Union. In addition, thousands of scientists, engineers, philosophers attend and present either independently or with associations ranging from former Case For Mars conference members to The American Astronautical Society, NASA, RAND Corporation, and more.

The minimalistic Mars Direct@footnote{See @ref{Mars Direct} for more information on Mars Direct.} approach of travelling light, living off of the land, and using indigenous materials to produce the fuel necessary for the journey home is again a central theme, but with more emphasis on the nature of the duration on Mars.

@sp 1

@quotation
"Zero capability missions have no value. The Mars Direct mission having demonstrated successfully the feasibility of sending humans to Mars, the bar now can and should be pushed. The attendees concluded unanimously that it is not prudent to return merely for the sake of demonstrating that a safe return is possible, that having already been established, but to create a permanent settlement on Mars. The new mission architecture proposed would be designed to bootstrap the first non-terrestrial expansion of human civilization for the benefit of all mankind."
@end quotation
@sp 1

The plan's abstract outline is as such:
@sp 1
\itemize
\item
@b{Phase I:} Create a spacestation in low Earth orbit to act as a construction berth for trans-Martian spacecraft, supplied by single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles.
@sp 1

\item
Send a spacecraft constructed in that spacestation that carries the minimum necessary to bootstrap a settlement, like @math{H_2}. Use a nuclear electric ion-drive propulsion system to get there with indigenous resources to supply the return propellant.
@sp 1

\item
Crew would deploy construction equipment and machinery to process indigenous materials for further expansion and self sustenance, aided with a nuclear reactor. This constitute a permanent outpost, the @dfn{Arcadian Settlement}.
@sp 1

\item
Spacecraft returns to Earth unmanned, but fully fuelled having used {\it in situ} methane/oxygen propellant. Concurrently, the settlement continues to expand available habitats, greenhouses, and other infrastructure.
@sp 1

\item
@b{Phase II:} Personnel ferries departing Earth at regular intervals would augment the settlement in population and available expansion potential through the additionally provided manpower.
@sp 1

@end itemize

A preliminary draft of the @dfn{Mars Treaty} is produced using a revised {\it Outer Space Treaty} of 1967 A.D. as a basis for a subset of it. The treaty provides the contractual basis for all signatories, outlining the roadmap, responsibilities, and party resource allocations necessary to serve as a vehicle for the terraformation and first manned mission to Mars operating under a United Nations mandate. The treaty also provides an agreement governing the activities of states on Mars and its two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

The terraformation strategy is to be initiated by intercepting {\it 52048 Varuna} and deflecting it to directly impact Mars using a nuclear warhead. Being a C-type asteroid, it contains high levels of hydrated (water-containing) minerals which, when released into the atmosphere as aerosols, will greatly increase the total available cloud condensation nuclei. 

Data was presented at the summit predicting that the direct effect of the introduction of these new dark, carbonaceous, aerosols would be a decrease in albedo since they absorb more solar radiation. This would cause a cascading series of reactions, increasing the mean surface temperature and atmospheric pressure.

The deflection strategy will have the asteroid impact directly over the Martian south pole. The south pole contains a large sheet of buried COâ‚‚ ice approximately 8m thick which, when sublimated, will act as a powerful greenhouse gas, thickening the atmosphere, along with the underlying water ice beneath it.

While the legalities of the project are defined in the {\it Mars Treaty}, the international collaborative project it implicates is known as the @dfn{Avaneya Initiative}.

@dfn{United Nations General Assembly Resolution 5571} is adopted making the Mars Treaty ratified. The resolution augments {\it Chapter III} of the {\it United Nations Charter} to beget its seventh principle organ, the @dfn{Space Agency} (UNSA). It is bestowed with a mandate enacting the treaty, and by implication, the Avaneya Initiative.

The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) is dissolved. Its former responsibilities are transferred to UNSA under its new mandate.

The resolution also requires members to accede the North American Union Aeronautical and Space Agency (NASA), European Space Agency (ESA), Asian Aerospace Exploration Agency (AAXA), and all other national member space agencies under centralized UNSA administration. This is granted under the justification that space exploration and settlement ought to be an endeavour for all mankind, best realized through the aggregation of resources.

Lieberman is nominated to the Office of the President of the UNSA, resigning his position as director for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Lockheed Martin-Boeing is awarded a contract to provide three, leased, single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO), manned, re-usable, @dfn{VentureStar VII} class suborbital spaceplanes named {\it Aravans}@footnote{Sanskrit for a steed or horse.}. These vehicles provide UNSA with heavy lift workhorses for ferrying personnel and materials to the {\it Iterum Shipyard}. They require no external solid booster rockets or external fuel tank and each operate at less than @math{{1 / 5}^{th} } the cost of the retired Space Shuttles.

Lockheed Martin-Boeing is also awarded 21 billion bancors worth of contracts to incrementally provide four direct-launch ferries capable of carrying payload of 150 personnel each, plus provisions. The @dfn{Tarikins}@footnote{Sanskrit for a ferry-man.} will shuttle settlers to Mars using a nuclear electric ion-drive propulsion system for the outbound trajectory, then provided in orbit with return methane/oxygen (@math{CH_4}/@math{O_2}) propellant manufactured in {\it in situ}. The {\it Tarkins} will depart Earth every 780 day minimum-energy launch window, taking 180 days to arrive at Mars in constant rotation with each other.

Arda formally addresses the Secretary-General of the United Nations through an internationally broadcast speech over Solnet. Arda likens the settlers predicament in his provocative speech to that of {\it "the latest manifestation of the classic banana republic with its contemporary adaptation endlessly railgun-catapulting deuterium across the solar system in an effort to entertain the insatiable Terran appetite for usury and absurd infinite growth Cornucopian models. Arcadia's greatest achievement has occurred today in its realization that it can do better, that Earth has nothing that it needs, that it will not follow in its examples, and that the era of the Red Cornucopian breadbasket and its Horn of Plenty is over."}

Arda concludes his speech acknowledging his passage that morning of the @dfn{Rubicon Act}, initiating steps to secure the settlement's independence and begetting the first non-terrestrial, autonomous, city-state. Notable portions of the Act include:
@sp 1

@cartouche
\itemize
\item
@dfn{Article I} declares the colony an independent, sovereign, self-governed, constitutional republic, with the right to self determination. It is self-styled the @dfn{Republic of Arcadia Planitia (RAP)}, colloquially known by its capital and sole city @dfn{Arcadia}.
@sp 1

\item
@dfn{Article II} defines the head of state, the @dfn{Direct Council}. As a direct democracy, governance circumvents elected representatives by directly polling the populace digitally. This office functions as both the legislative and executive branches of government. An @dfn{Executor} is elected through the {\it Direct Council}, along with their cabinet. The Executor and their cabinet are responsible for implementing the edicts of the {\it Direct Council}. The {\it Direct Council} cannot be circumvented under any circumstance, including that of an emergency.

\item
@dfn{Article VII} superannuates the bancor fiat currency with the @dfn{jenya},@footnote{See @ref{Jenya}.} the first currency to be backed by a rhodium standard. The jenya becomes the exclusive legal tender within the Republic. This requires all Terran interests to acquire Arcadian goods in jenyas only.
@sp 1

\item
@dfn{Article VIII} defines the state's disposition with respect to the military. The creation of a permanent or temporary standing army is forbidden. The creation of militias is permitted with exclusive executive authority resting in the {\it Direct Council}. The militia's three restrictions are that it is forbidden from deployment outside of Arcadia's territorial lands, that its purpose is exclusively defensive, and that it cannot be deployed domestically as an aid to civil power.
