\StartSection{Single Player}
Let us start with an overview of the different modalities of play. These can be either single or multiplayer. Single player, as the name suggest, the user plays alone. Well, actually, with the computer and the challenges it presents. This includes a tutorial, campaign, and custom mode. The user can also restore from a saved game in all three modes if they wish.

In tutorial mode, the user is guided through interaction with the elements of the game and its user interface by Khalid Zafar, one of the leading characters described in \in{chapter}[Leading Characters]. The aim is to train the user to the point where they are comfortable in taking on the campaign or even multiplayer.

In campaign mode, the user assumes the role of Arda Baştürk, or any of the other leading characters, as they journey through the campaign which takes place near and following the end of the fictional timeline described in \in{section}[Aftermath & Diaspora]. That is, around the time of the Arcadian Diaspora.

The custom mode allows users to specifically select which scenarios they would like to play without thought of commitment to a full campaign. This is useful for those who would like to explore nonlinear gameplay. We will discuss scenarios further in \in{section}[Scenarios].
