% Terms & Concepts chapter...
\StartChapter{Terms and Concepts}

The following is a collection of terminology used in various places in this book. Some of these terms appear in the fictional \about[Leading Characters], \about[Timeline], and \about[Game World].

% Albedo...
\StartSection{Albedo}
The proportion of incoming light reflected by a surface. This is the ratio of reflected light to total incident light. A material with an albedo of 1 is a perfect mirror whereas a material with an albedo of 0 absorbs all incident light.

% ATATÜRK
\StartSection{ATATÜRK}
NAU--CIA's cryptonym for Arda Baştürk. The name is drawn from Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881--1938 A.D.), an Ottoman and Turkish intellectual, army officer, writer, statesman, and first president of the Republic of Turkey. See \in{section}[Arda Baştürk] for more on Arda.

% Bancor...
\StartSection{Bancor}
A global currency proposed in the early 1940s by the British economist John Maynard Keynes. On 13 April 2010 the {\it Strategy, Policy and Review Department of the International Monetary Fund} published a paper\footnotecite[imf_bancor] recommending the world adopt the bancor and create an international central bank to administer it. The game world adopts the small Greek beta character \quote{\Bancor} as the bancor's currency symbol.

% Cornucopianism...
\StartSection{Cornucopianism}
The term {\it cornucopia} comes from the Greek legend of the magical horn of plenty. It was capable of providing the bearer with an abundance of anything desired.

Today cornucopianism is an economic school of thought that argues increased demand for resources as a function of time can always be met with increases in the means used to acquire them. As an example, advocates sometimes argue that peak oil is not a problem because either we will never run out, new innovations will reveal new reserves, or future technological advances will provide alternative forms of energy in time.

This position implicitly requires that systems with aspirations for infinite growth never outgrow their hosting environments, either because the environment is treated as infinite or for some other reason. This is contrasted with \about[Malthusianism].

% Corporate personhood...
\StartSection{Corporate Personhood}
A corporate charter creates a legal fiction with many of the fundamental rights of an actual human being. These may include the rights to own and sell assets, and to sue and be sued. In the context of the law a corporate person is treated very similarly as a living human being.

Critics argue that personhood ensures that actual individuals responsible for its direction are shielded and seldom personally held accountable. Advocates for corporate personhood argue it promotes economic prosperity which increases the quality of life for the general public.

% ERV...
\StartSection{Earth Return Vehicle (ERV)}
Earth return vehicles are capable of ascending from the surface of Mars and directly returning to Earth. Once they land on Mars, they can refuel themselves automatically from the atmosphere using the Sabatier reactor technology (\in{section}[Sabatier Reactor]).

% Endothermic reaction...
\StartSection{Endothermic Reaction}
A chemical reaction that requires external energy to be added. An example would be cooking an egg. The egg does not change unless you add heat to it. This is in contrast with an exothermic reaction.

% Exothermic reaction...
\StartSection{Exothermic Reaction}
A chemical reaction that releases its own energy. An example would be burning wood fuel. As the fuel changes, it releases energy in the form of mostly heat.

% FAP...
\StartSection{Free Arcadia Partisans (FAP)}
Free Arcadia partisans are a political and ideological movement in the Arcadian Settlement in the years leading up to its independence. They were instrumental in the drafting of the Arcadian Constitution and in encouraging an Arcadia free of Terran political and economic control. Prior to Year Zero, its existence and activities remained clandestine.

% Fifth column...
\StartSection{Fifth Column}
A clandestine force that undermines a greater power from within. The term originated during the Spanish Civil War on Earth in reference to a \quote{fifth column} of supporters within the city of Madrid that would support the four columns of military forces attempting to place the city under siege.

% In situ...
\StartSection{In Situ}
From the Latin, in position. When used in space--related contexts it means a situation where something is not done or made available until in the actual field and not prior. An example is the manufacture of a particular resource that may have alternatively been imported.

% Malthusianism...
\StartSection{Malthusianism}
Malthusianism is the doctrine of the 18\high{th} century English political economist, Reverend Thomas Malthus (1766--1834), so named after him. He argued that populations tend to increase at a rate that eventually exceeds their environmental carrying capacity. When this occured, he predicted that human suffering would inevitably follow.\footnotecite[malthus1798]

The 19\high{th} century Belgian mathematician, Pierre--François Verhulst, after having read Malthus' seminal works, {\it An Essay on the Principle of Population}, produced his famous Verhulst equation shown in \in{formula}[formula:Verhulst equation]. It is solved here for population as a function of time.
\crlf

\placeformula[formula:Verhulst equation]
\startformula
P(t) = \frac{K P_0 e^{rt}}
             {K + P_0(e^{r t} - 1)}
\stopformula
\startlegend
\leg P \\ population at time {\it t} \\ \\
\leg t \\ time \\ \\
\leg K \\ maximum carrying capacity \\ \\
\leg P_0 \\ initial population \\ \\
\leg r \\ growth rate \\ \\
\stoplegend
\crlf

Note how in \in{formula}[formula:Limit of Verhulst equation] that as time goes on, the population will always asymptotically approach {\it K}. That is, it keeps getting closer and closer to {\it K}, but can never actually surpass it. This is known as the {\it law of population growth} in ecology, the science of the interaction of organisms and their environments.
\crlf

\placeformula[formula:Limit of Verhulst equation]
\startformula
\lim_{t\to\infty} P(t) = K.
\stopformula
\crlf

When the Verhulst equation is plotted, it looks like \in{figure}[figure:Verhulst equation]. The population's maximum carrying capacity is denoted by {\it K}. It starts off with near exponential growth, but then rapidly decelerates as resources are consumed.

    {The Verhulst equation illustrating the law of population growth.}
    {\externalfigure[Terms_and_Concepts/Images/Law_of_Population_Growth.svg][][width=.5\textwidth]}

Malthusians acknowledge the inherent danger of systems with aspirations for infinite growth operating within the constraints of a finite environment. This is often contrasted with \about[Cornucopianism].

On the surface, although Malthus' observations seem obvious at first glance, it is not to certain political and social demographics. It is also interesting to explore how these two contrasting schools of thought actually form the basis for much of the contemporary thinking underlying innumerable heated debates across the social, political, economic, and even technological strata. Although the law of population growth is not a political philosophy, but a basic tenet of ecology, its Cornucopian critics are usually some combination of a particular theological interpretation\footnotecite[rawstory2010_god_wont_allow_global_warming] or of a secular neo--classical economic philosophy, like that of Milton Friedman (1912--2006) or his derivatives.

Critics of Malthusianism are sometimes drawn to attack Malthus himself by pointing out that Malthus had advocated extreme measures of population control, such as execution of surplus population. However, nearly always, it is evident that Malthus' original writings on the subject were either not read, selected portions exaggerated, or his critics misunderstood that his philosophy as cited today is less concerned with his proposals as it is with acknowledging that our environment is finite.

% Mars Direct...
\StartSection{Mars Direct}
Mars Direct is a \dollar 50 billion dollar plan proposed by American aerospace engineer Robert Zubrin\index{Robert Zubrin} (born 19 April 1952). It is an alternative to the prohibitively costly \dollar 450 billion dollar mission to Mars proposed by NASA in consultation with the United States government.

The then incumbent President\index{President of the United States} George H. W. Bush\index{George H. W. Bush} announced the government's proposal in 1989 as the {\it Space Exploration Initiative\index{Space Exploration Initiative}}. It called for the creation of the {\it Space Station Freedom\index{Space Station Freedom}} and a permanent Lunar base\index{Lunar base} as intermediate steps for an ultimate destination to the Red Planet. If implemented, it was allegedly to be rolled out over the process of several decades.

Zubrin reasoned that it was totally unnecessary to construct giant costly space stations in low Earth orbit, Lunar bases of questionable utility on a barren moon, and massive spacecraft carrying hundreds of people to achieve a manned mission to Mars. That, along with transporting all that is necessary to get them there, sustain them, and return safely. He argued that the government prefers a solution that is larger than necessary for a variety of reasons, including the illusion of progress, productivity, employment, contracts, and bureaucratic expansion. He argued that such a plan would come at the cost of monumental waste, misdirected resources, and, through increased mission complexity, an increased probability of mission failure.

Zubrin compared SEI proposal to the failed Arctic explorer, Sir John Franklin\index{Sir John Franklin}, who with government assistance in 1845 took two ships, the {\it Erebus} and {\it Terror}, each displacing more than 300 tonnes in an effort to navigate through the Northwest Passage\index{Northwest Passage}. His ships carried excessive provisions, including heavy English silverware, but spared many of the critical items essential for the crew's survival.

The crew met with an inevitable bitter end as they dragged heavy iron and oak sleds across the Arctic ice after having abandoned their vessels which became frozen in the ice. With shotguns useless in Arctic conditions and other heavy and inappropriate equipment, all 127 men perished to a combination of the elements and scurvy. It never occurred to them to take advantage of {\it in situ} resources, like fur coats, algae, seals, and fish.

Zubrin argued that the SEI's mission architecture was the inverse of a sound engineering approach. He outlined in his book {\it The Case For Mars} a minimalistic approach of travelling light, living off the land, and manufacturing the necessary rocket propellant for the return trip {\it in situ}, analogous to the efforts of early successful settlers on Earth, such as those who pushed through the American Western Frontier. Going to another planet is, according to him, no different. Indeed, the travel time to Mars is even comparable to that of navigating the Northwest Passage.

Zubrin suggested this trans--planetary travel to Mars is possible because of the wealth Mars already contains. It has an abundance of natural resources necessary for creating rocket fuels, water, plastic polymers, alloyed metals, glass, useful gasses like oxygen, semi--conductors, ceramics, and just about everything else one might require. All this he calculated at a fraction of the cost of NASA's proposal and using technology that has been around since the mid--19\high{th} century.\footnote{See the RWGS and Sabatier reactors in sections \in{}[Reverse-Water-Gas-Shift Reactor] and \in{}[Sabatier Reactor] respectively.} He maintains his plan could be realized in less than a decade by leveraging existing technology, as opposed to the several decades required of plans like the SEI.

% Money as free speech...
\StartSection{Money As Free Speech}
In 1976 A.D., the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in {\it Buckley v. Valeo} that, while there must be limits on contributions to political campaigns, spending money to influence elections without limit is permissible. The logic being that since corporations are considered legal persons, and since the rights of persons are constitutionally protected under the 14\high{th} amendment, and since corporate media has the right to freedom of the press (speech), corporations therefore ought to have freedom of speech as well. Since they are not capable of speech in the physical sense, the closest analogue is money.

% Regolith...
\StartSection{Regolith}
What most refer to as dirt. More technically, it is the the loose heterogeneous mixture of material that blankets the solid rock of a planet. Although the term may seem redundant with \quote{dirt} or \quote{earth}, the latter refers to regolith from a particular planet while the former means regolith that contains organic materials which is not known to exist on Mars.

% RWGS reactor...
\StartSection{Reverse-Water-Gas-Shift Reactor}
The RWGS reactor is a method of producing oxygen (\chemical{O_2}) from carbon dioxide (\chemical{CO_2}). This is useful because the latter is plentiful in the Martian atmosphere at 95 \%.

\placeformula[reaction:Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction]
\startformula
\inlinechemical{CO_2,+,H_2,+,->,H_2O,+,CO}
\stopformula

The process has been known since the mid 1800s and works by reacting carbon dioxide and hydrogen gasses together over a copper--on--alumina catalyst. Aqua (liquid water) and carbon monoxide gas are produced as byproducts. This is illustrated in \in{reaction}[reaction:Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction].

The resulting aqua is then split via electrolysis to produce molecular hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen can be recycled back into the reactor and the carbon monoxide purged back out into the atmosphere or captured for other purposes.

The reactor needs to be at \math{400\,^{\circ}{\rm C}} and at a low pressure. It requires about 180 watts of power, or about 3 \math{m^2} of solar panels on a fully sunny day's average solar flux. At that energy rate, you can expect to produce about 1 kg per day of oxygen, which is sufficient for a single person. The reactor requires power because it is an endothermic reaction. However, it is possible to use a Sabatier reactor in tandem which is an exothermic reaction to provide the heat required to drive the RWGS reaction.

To start the process, only a small amount of water is required which acts as a reagent. Otherwise one needs to import some hydrogen from Earth, but this only needs to be done once.

Some of the reactors featured in Avaneya are augmented forms of that just described which incorporate the electrolysis directly into the machine to produce \chemical{O_2} from the water produced, then cycling the \chemical{H_2} back into the reactor.

% Sabatier reactor...
\StartSection{Sabatier Reactor}
A chemical process for creating methane \chemical{CH_4} from \chemical{CO_2} and hydrogen. This is useful because carbon dioxide gas is plentiful in the Martian atmosphere at 95 \%.

\placeformula[reaction:Sabatier Reaction]
\startformula
\inlinechemical{CO_2,+,4H_2,->,CH_4,+,2H_2O,+,heat}
\stopformula

The reactor needs to be at \math{400\,^{\circ}{\rm C}} and at a low pressure. This makes it almost the same as the RWGS reactor except that it uses a different catalyst to produce methane instead of carbon monoxide. You can either use nickel, which is cheap, or ruthenium--on--alumina, which is safer but more expensive. This process is described in \in{reaction}[reaction:Sabatier Reaction].

% Sierra
\StartSection{Sierra}
Mars Command (MARSCOM) designation for a \quote{settler} of the Arcadian Settlement using military phonetic alphabet.

% Sol...
\StartSection{Sol}
Short for solar day, the length of time a planet takes to rotate completely on its polar axis with respect to the Sun. Terrans call this a day while Martians call it a sol, though the solar day of the latter is slightly longer. The Arcadian method of timekeeping is described in detail in \in{section}[Time]. See also {\it yestersol} in \in{section}[Yestersol]. 

% Specific impulse...
\StartSection{Specific Impulse}
Written \math{I_{sp}}, the specific impulse is a useful metric for comparing rocket efficiency. Whenever you see the word \quote{specific} in a physics context, it means something per unit of mass. The units here are in seconds. Specific impulse measures the amount of time that one pound of fuel will burn to produce one pound of thrust -- higher being better. This can be calculated using either SI or Imperial units, but the end result is usually expressed in seconds (SI).

As an example, compare the specific impulse of some different types of rockets:

Note how high the specific impulse a jet engine offers. This is because it has an unlimited supply of free air from the atmosphere to feed the air compressor so it does not have to carry its own supply.

% Yestersol...
\StartSection{Yestersol}
The sol preceding the current one. This is the Martian analogue to the Terran yesterday, but different since the length of a sol on both worlds is different. The Arcadian method of timekeeping is described in detail in \in{section}[Time]. See also \about[Sol].
