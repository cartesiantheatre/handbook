% AresEngine architectural design...
\StartSection{AresEngine's Architecture}

A game engine is the \quotation{operating system} of a game. Our game engine is the AresEngine. Although designed with this project in mind, it is kept architecturally general enough whenever possible to be reusable. For an excellent and comprehensive coverage of the field of game engines, see Jason Gregory's book.\footnotecite[game_engine_architecture]

Our engine is divided up into many subsystems as is common of game engines. Each one is responsible for a given logical task. These include audio, input, graphical user interface, physics, resource management, simulation, and others. Umbrello was used to design many of these systems.

The following diagrams were pulled from the AresEngine's Umbrello project file automatically at the time this handbook was typeset on \currentdate\ from Bzr revision \BzrRevisionClickable. The version used was \UmbrelloVersion.

% Artificial intelligence subsubsection...
\StartSubSection{Artificial Intelligence}

This diagram shows the artificial intelligence classes, though not enough to warrant its own subsystem (yet). It contains an implementation of the A\high{*} search strategy algorithm. The solution here is modelled as a pattern for an abstract base class called {\tt AStarBase}. The {\tt h(x)} heuristic function is implemented via an override on a context specific superclass. This later abstract base class is deliberately kept general so as to not be limited to searching for a solution in a spatial sense, but in any representable solution space. That might be time, language, or something else we need later.

% Audio subsubsection...
\page
\StartSubSection{Audio}
The {\tt AudioManager} subsystem is responsible for managing audio related tasks. Audio playback is divided into streaming and static audio sources.

Streaming sources need to be continuously updated by loading new data from disk, decompressing, and then playing them. This is usually music, a narrative, or anything longer than a few seconds.

Static sources are smaller and only need to be played once before being freed. These are short sound effects played repetitively and lasting no longer than a few seconds.

Decompression is done through an appropriate subclass of an {\tt Ares::AudioDecoderBase} abstract class, instantiated via the {\tt Ares::AudioDecoderFactory} class. Most decoding is done through a subclass of the aforementioned via {\tt SDL_audio}. Playback is done through OpenAL for three--dimensional spatialized audio whenever available.

Currently there are only two ways of getting surround sound from a computer to any kind of home theatre setup. One way is the \index{surround sound:+analog}analog method with a wire for every speaker connected to the user's sound card. This makes a mess, but works for many. The programmer does not really have to do much work to get this working because the drivers do the signal routing.

A better way is the \index{surround sound:+digital}digital method. This works by passing a compressed digital stream unmodified from the source medium out to specialized dedicated hardware, usually in the form of a digital home theatre receiver (e.g. Logitech Z--5500). The receiver decodes a superior signal compared to the analog method. It then amplifies the signal before sending it out on its way to the user's speakers. 

But there is a problem to take advantage of this latter digital method with Avaneya. At present nearly every digital home theatre receiver supports two very common digital surround sound compressed formats. One of these is Dolby Digital, sometimes called AC--3 or A52, and the other is the Digital Theatre System or DTS. Both are patent encumbered. We need to be careful how we encode to these bitstreams. 

The {\tt libasound_module_pcm_a52.so} library is a plugin for ALSA and therefore only available on supported platforms (usually GNU/Linux). It is a frontend for for an encoder in {\tt libav}. The latter provides a way to encode a digital surround sound stream in A52 format to a pass--through device (e.g S/PDIF). The user's home theatre receiver then takes over from there. The difficult is in this {\tt libasound_module_pcm_a52.so} library sometimes not being available in most distributions that provide pre--compiled packages of ALSA. This may be due to the aforementioned licensing issue. 

What we need to do is several things in order to make A52 output work. First we need to ensure at runtime that the user has the {\tt libasound2-plugins} package installed. This provides the needed {\tt libasound_module_pcm_a52.so} library. Secondly we need to either verify that the user's libav was built with the A52 encoder enabled, or fallback to one we ship ourselves somehow.

Whatever we decide to do we need to make sure that this feature is disabled by default due to Dolby's licensing requirement. We can leave it as an option for the user to enable if they know that software patents are not valid in their locality (e.g. Europe), but we still need to balance several constraints. These include legalities, reasonable expectations and ease of use for the user, and ease of maintenance on our part. Probably the best way to do this is to provide all of this functionality separately and isolated within an optional and properly disclaimered {\tt avaneya-restricted} package.

If we can get A52 working there is no reason to spend time on redundant DTS support as well since they both do the same thing. Where one is supported on a given receiver, nearly without exception so is the other.

% Configuration subsubsection...
\page
\StartSubSection{Configuration}
The {\tt ConfigurationManager} subsystem is responsible for storing all user configuration. The {\tt Load()} method reads all configuration variables from disk and then adds variables from the command line as well, in that order. 

Configuration variables passed over the command line are set as non--archivable. A non--archivable configuration variable is one that is not persistent (saved to disk).

Probably the bulk of this subsystem could be implemented in Lua because of its excellent handling for databases.

% Console subsubsection...
\page
\StartSubSection{Console}
The in--game console allows users to access aspects of the game engine at runtime. This is useful for debugging or other purposes. The actual console commands can be implemented in Lua.

% Design patterns subsubsection...
\page
\StartSubSection{Design Patterns}
This diagram contains a number of common design patterns familiar to many software engineers, such as the singleton and multi--factory.

On the subject of the singleton there seems to be two kinds of design patterns in the literature that are not distinguished but probably should be. There is the kind whose instantiation is implicit -- meaning you don't care when it is created, just as long as it is there when you need it and that there is only at most one of them. We will call this the {\it implicit singleton}. Most implementations use lazy instantiation.

The second kind, like the first, only ever has one instance. The difference is that you can control when it is instantiated and destroyed explicitly. We refer to this as the {\it explicit singleton}. This is useful for game engine subsystems because C++ does not define the order in which constructors for global objects are invoked across translation units. This is very important since the order of subsystem initialization cannot be random. Consider that the resource subsystem must be available before the audio subsystem because the latter depends on the former.

% Events subsubsection...
\page 
\StartSubSection{Events}
The {\tt EventManager} is responsible for intercommunication between various engine components and scripts.

An event handler can either contain an {\tt Ares::EventHandler} class, or it can derive from one and override the {\tt OnEvent()} method. It registers interest in one or more events via the {\tt Register()} method like so.

\startCodeExample
// Bind the some_event to our event handler...
m_EventHandler.Register("some_event");
\stopCodeExample

Next, to create and enqueue an event, one would do as follows:
\startCodeExample
// Create a some_event event...
Ares::Event SomeEvent("some_event");

// Enqueue the event...
Ares::EventManager::GetSingleton().Enqueue(SomeEvent);
\stopCodeExample

Every frame the {\tt EventManager::DispatchEvents()} method is called to pump the message queue. It will get an event from the internal priority queue that is due for processing. Once an event is fetched, it invokes {\tt Event.Dispatch()} to pass it to all registered handlers. The handler may do whatever they want when that event is triggered. This includes consuming the event or propagating it.

{\tt Events.xsd} defines an XML schema that the engine uses at runtime to check event types for syntactical correctness. The actual event types are defined in {\tt Events.xml}. This latter file contains a list of built--in event types which are engine specific and Avaneya agnostic. They are general purpose events and include things for input devices and the player's desktop environment's window manager.

% File System subsubsection...
\page 
\StartSubSection{File System}
Accessing files on disk for textures, shaders, scripts, models, sounds, and the like requires an intermediary in most engines. This is because the file system exposed to a game engine is typically a virtual file system with the files likely stored inside of special custom archives.

You might be wondering why this is necessary, as opposed to simply exposing \quotation{naked} files directly through the platform's native file system. There are a number of benefits to using a custom archive format, such as a zip. It can be easier to distribute a few files containing many, than many to the end user. As a single file potentially containing many, file seek, open, and load times are reduced. Providing a layer of abstraction between the actual raw data and the client that requires it allows us to decompress the payload on the fly. This results in a smaller file which means a faster disk to memory transfer. Remember that the disk is slow but the CPU is much faster.

% Gooey subsubsection...
\page 
\StartSubSection{Gooey}
The {\tt GooeyManager} is responsible for managing all graphical user interface overlays and user interaction with them. The underlying functionality is provided by CEGUI which integrates well with the Ogre3D renderer.

{\tt GooeyManager::Initialize()} calls {\tt CEGUI::OgreRenderer::bootstrapSystem()}. This bootstraps {\tt CEGUI::System} with an {\tt OgreRenderer} object that uses the default Ogre rendering window as the default output surface, an Ogre3D based {\tt ResourceProvider}, and an Ogre3D based {\tt ImageCodec}.

{\tt Update()} is called every frame, but we do not need to call {\tt System::renderGUI()} since Ogre does this automatically. We do, however, need to call {\tt CEGUI::System::injectTimePulse()} within it. We also need to inject input events into CEGUI when we detect user input device activity, such as clicking or moving the mouse.

Our {\tt Shutdown()} method invokes {\tt CEGUI::OgreRenderer::destroySystem()}.

Most of the interesting interfaces are within CEGUI singletons themselves, with appropriate accessors and mutators exported to Lua.

% Human Interface subsubsection...
\page 
\StartSubSection{Human Interface}
The {\tt HumanInterfaceManager} takes care of routing all events from input devices to the appropriate code that registered to be notified of the event. In that sense the manager is mostly unidirectional, but also allows sending some information the other way back to the input device. We do this if it supports haptic capabilities or what is sometimes called force feedback. We chose to call it haptic for the sake of consistency because that is what our underlying {\tt SDL_haptic} API calls it.

% Logging & Error Control subsubsection...
\page 
\StartSubSection{Logging & Error Control}
The {\tt LogManager} is responsible for providing a central logging subsystem for all the other subsystems.

\FullPageDiagram
    {figure:LoggingUML}
    {The logging and error control subsystem.}
    {Engineer_Contributors/Images/AresEngine/Logging and Error Control.svg}
    
Since messages can be emitted from any number of places within the engine or within some other externally linked component, such as CEGUI or Ogre3D, messages have to be intercepted and directed through the {\tt LogManager} into the appropriate channel. Otherwise there would be no one consistent place to find them. 

The following diagram should make this mechanism more clear.

% Resources subsubsection...
\page 
\StartSubSection{Resources}
The {\tt ResourceManager} is responsible for ensuring that whenever code needs a piece of game media such as a model or animation, all of its prerequisites are loaded in the correct order, only once, taking up no more memory than necessary, and for no longer than required. The {\tt ResourceManager} and {\tt FileManager} communicate to help the former locate what it needs wherever it may happen to be.
