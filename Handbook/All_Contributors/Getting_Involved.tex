\StartSection{Getting Involved}
We encourage everyone in the community intrigued with this project to get involved. There is something for everyone to do, regardless of their areas of expertise and strengths. We take pride in our professional work, as all {\it libre} projects should, but we discourage elitism. Knowledge must be shared.

This project does many good things for the contributing members of our community, besides being incredibly entertaining. Their experiences can be taken to enrich other {\it libre} projects, and vice versa. The project encourages cooperation and team work across the planet. It provides difficult, albeit rewarding, challenges of countless types and thus, for those who want it, street credit as well. It can also add to one's skills through direct experience which many less fortunate, actually most, cannot afford formal instruction in. But on a larger level, it contributes to society's technological and cultural wealth in ways that superficial proprietary software cannot. This is perhaps the greatest feature {\it libre} culture offers the world.

Contributions need not be large and complex to be useful. Not everyone needs to be a programmer either. Indeed, programming is just one of the many facets of this project. There must be story writers, documentation writers, 3D modellers, graphic designers, and more for the project to see itself through to fruition. Contributions can come in all different shapes and sizes. It might be one line of code altered deep within the engine to repair a serious bug, a few human readable strings of the user interface translated into another language, updated music, an enhanced story line, more voice overs, some corrected typos, new textures, or improved material shaders. But {\it everyone} that makes a noteworthy contribution is listed in the game's credits.

Even if one does not contribute, everyone is certainly welcome to monitor the master branch; idle or converse with us on IRC; and to subscribe, read, and post on our mailing lists.\footnote{We will expand on how to do this in \in{chapter}[Communication].}

This is an exciting project. For whatever reason, since it was first announced, there has been no shortage of people expressing interest and a desire to get involved -- and not just gamers or {\it libre} culture advocates, but educators, artists, musicians, scientists, activists, culture jammers, writers, and many more. This should be a good thing. 

But we recommend that no one ask to join the project unless they are actually serious. We say this with the utmost respect and gratitude. If one wishes to become involved, they can. But if for no more than to simply associate merely for the sake of association, or they genuinely come with the best of intentions but lack the time to do whatever it is that they wanted to do, then this is not in the project's interest. Consider that the project maintainers too have limited time and resources available for cleaning up potential incomplete messes people leave behind, or assisting new comers get \quote{plugged in} to our workflow. Remember that even with the best documentation in the world, people will still have questions.

With that in mind, it was realized that the best approach is to welcome anyone into our community, but only accept those who wish to be acknowledged as contributors only after their having actually done so. This philosophy protects both the project maintainers' time and the new comer's. It also helps to ensure that the project maintains its productivity and high standards. 

If you would like to get involved, the best way to do so is to take the initiative and solve a practical problem, provide something needed, or propose a solution you have thought about and are willing to implement. To get an idea of the project's immediate needs, take a look at the issue tracker described in \in{section}[Issue Tracking] to see a list of some of the outstanding issues to date after reading the \about[Orientation] in \in{section}[Orientation].
