\StartChapter{Preface}

Avaneya is a cerebral science fiction game targeted primarily towards people who enjoy the Ubuntu operating system (which is based on GNU).\footnotecite[gnu_users_who_have_never_heard_of_gnu] This handbook is intended for Avaneya's ever-growing community of contributors who would like to get involved in this very exciting project. This is not a guide for people that simply want to play Avaneya. For information on actual game play, please refer to our Avaneya Player Manual.

This document will likely continue to be revised frequently and improved with time, especially when this project is in its  early stages. Therefore, because it is a living document, it is better to pass on a direct \href{\LatestHandbookURL}{link} to the most current revision within our project's set of blueprints than it is to give another a potentially outdated local copy. We will discuss blueprints further later in \in{section}[Blueprints].

This handbook has several purposes:

\startitemize[4]
\item
To encourage contributors to refine their ideas, think them through, and commit them to paper where their ideas are available for deliberation and public review;

\item
To define the project as clearly as possible within a single, consolidated, canonical location so contributors have something to reference;

\item
To politely prevent current contributors from having to explain things when their explanations are already contained within this book;\footnote[rtfm]{It is a good idea to ask questions, but as we say in the hacker community, always read the documentation first.}

\item
Lastly, to appease the odd doubtful naysayer that we did indeed undertake thoughtful due diligence, that the project was not simply \quote{tavern talk}, and that we are prepared to see it through to completion.
\stopitemize

This book is intended for contributors in our community, and may not be as appropriate for players. Indeed, the handbook may spoil elements of the game. Consider yourself warned!

On the other hand, players of Avaneya are just as likely to enrich this game through constructive feedback. This feedback is best buttressed with the well-informed understanding of the project that this book can provide.
