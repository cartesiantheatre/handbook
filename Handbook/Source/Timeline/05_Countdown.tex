Footage of alleged riots erupting across Arcadia with security forces responding disproportionately are aired across Earth. Mainstream media attribute the alleged riots to grievances expressed by dissenters at variance with Free Arcadia partisans who apparently relied upon use of force to silence them, but now, like Arda, hold public office at Arcadia Hall. The dissenters are coined {\it Red Unionists}. Several critics note the equivalence of Terran gravity in some of the footage allegedly obtained by citizens {\it in situ} but are rapidly dismissed by mainstream media as \quote{cranks} and \quote{conspiracy theorists}.

The United Nations Security Council passes resolution 12664 where it is adopted unanimously. The contents of the resolution are not as of yet made public, but kept internal. It begins with:

\startTimelineGeneralDocument
The Security Council,

Reaffirming the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations,

Determined to combat by all means threats to transplanetary peace and security caused by terrorist acts,

Deploring the gross and systematic violation of human rights, including the repression of peaceful demonstrators, expressing deep concern at the deaths of civilians, and rejecting unequivocally the incitement to hostility and violence against the civilian population and infrastructure excited through {\it in situ} administrative elements of the United Nations Arcadian Settlement,

Recognizing the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in accordance with the Charter,

\startitemize[n]
\setupwhitespace[big]
\item Unequivocally condemns in the strongest terms the horrifying terrorist attacks which took place recently at the site of the No. \type{#}2 Railgun on Mars in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement and regards such acts, like any act of international terrorism on Earth, as a threat to transplanetary peace and security;

\item Expresses its deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims, their families, and of the United Nations Arcadian Settlement;

\item Calls on all Mars Treaty signatories to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of these acts will be held accountable;

\item Calls also on all Mars Treaty signatories to redouble their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist acts including by increased cooperation and full implementation of the relevant anti-terrorist conventions and Security Council resolutions;

\item Expresses its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks of the Arcadian Settlement railgun bombing, and to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations;

\item Authorizes Mars Treaty signatories that have notified the Secretary-General, acting nationally or through regional organizations or arrangements, and acting in cooperation with the Secretary-General and the Office of the President of the Space Agency, to take all necessary measures to protect civilians, civilian populated areas, and assets under threat of attack in the United Nations Arcadian Settlement, and requests those signatories concerned to inform the Secretary-General immediately of the measures they take pursuant to the authorization conferred by this paragraph which shall be immediately reported to the Security Council;

\item Decides to remain actively seized of the matter.\footnote{Most Security Council resolutions end with this phrase. Article 12 of the United Nations charter states that \quote{While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation unless the Security Council so requests.} In other words, the General Assembly of many is being instructed by the Security Council of few to not interfere in an affair the latter still wishes to handle exclusively.}

The resolution recommends and authorizes the {\it United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations} (UNDPKO) to place all four of its permanently standing {\it Rapid Reaction Force} battalions on high alert.

\StartTimelineDate{A.R.}
The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations' {\it Joint Chiefs of Staff} assemble in Brussels, European Union. There they liaise with government officials and other high level military UN servants for the first day of a three month summit. The summit is conducted under maximum security. Though its existence is made public, the exercise of a high level of discretion in all of its activities ensures that its nature is not. This draws public criticism due to the presence of a number of high level state officials from across the planet and the lack of transparency.

Rumours spread rapidly over the solnet purporting the purpose of the summit as one of planning the first off world military occupation of another planet in history. Leaked documents suggest the summits agenda is to assess the feasibility, followed by addressing the preparation of all strategic, intelligence gathering, logistical, personnel, and financial planning necessary to conduct such an operation. Known high level UNSA liaisons, including UNSA's President Dr. Samuel Lieberman, are captured on camera being hustled in and out of meetings within the compound. Public speculation is further compounded when representatives of major international financial institutions and the NAU CIA director are also captured on camera by independent media.

UNDPKO's summit in Brussels concludes with the establishment of the newly formed {\it Mars Command (MARSCOM)}. It is established under the civilian administered UNDPKO and is now responsible for overseeing all of the latter's peacekeeping operations at the strategic level, in the route to, in the vicinity of, and on the Red Planet. The headquarters is located at Peterson Air Force Base, North American Union, and is jointly staffed by an international consortium of military personnel from all nations signatory to the Mars Treaty.

Arda receives an asymmetrically encrypted message warning of an allegedly imminent plan that was drafted by a consortium of Terran financial interests. The information was allegedly all drawn from leaked source material. The anonymous tip-off claims these interests have influenced the United Nations such that it is prepared to organize and land two battalions of peacekeepers, MARSBAT1 and MARSBAT2, to Martian theatre. The battalions will operate under UNSA's newly formed MARSCOM, which itself operates as an organ of the United Nations, which in turn allegedly answers to the Terran central banking cartels. 

The field commanders on the ground would be tasked with several prioritized strategic objectives while in theatre.

The anonymous informant provides detailed information on troop movement to Terran MARSCOM administered training facilities, size of units, weapons and tactics to be employed, probable location of encampment, and route of approach. The battalions will be deployed to Martian theatre under the banner of {\it United Nations Emergency Peacekeeping Force Mars (UNEPFM)}. The force draws elements mostly from North American Union and European Union units specializing in airborne light infantry, armoured reconnaissance, combat UAVs, and self-propelled artillery support.

The message is encrypted using a public key of Arda's not used since his long departed days of a military posting with the European Union's Mountain and Commando Brigade in Hakkari. He and his staff deem the message credible.

\StartTimelineDate{A.R.}
Arda directs the Systems Team to take out UNSA orbital surveillance capabilities by destroying UNSA's {\it Mars Enhanced Telecommunications Orbiter} while the settlement still has access. UNSA detects the settlement login attempt and transmits a command sequence instructing the orbiter to revoke Arcadia's keypair, but are several minutes too late. The orbiter burns up its entire hydrazine fuel reserves used for attitude control, deorbiting itself and incinerating during atmospheric entry.

All solnet communications between Earth and Mars that had been brokered by METO are now effectively disabled. However, the orbiter had also been used for reliable Arcadian intercommunication. Arcadians adapt in its absence with a combination of line-of-sight UHF and shortwave communication, requiring no satellite.

UNSA has its JPL lock down all four {\it Mars Positioning Satellites} in expectation of an RAP denial-of-service attack, though Arda has no intention of launching one. Arda's staff reason the satellites have no use as UNSA surveillance assets and are still useful for their own navigation on the Red Planet.
